Welcome! 
  
Our interactive textbook and its accompanying resources for teachers are intended to promote learning from the NASEM (2021) materials. Because the NASEM (2021) narrative and software were designed for advanced dairy nutrition practitioners, they may be difficult for less-experienced learners. Our interactive textbook is designed to highlight core concepts that will assist learners in understanding the NASEM narrative and utilizing the mathematical model in practice.
