<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Background<a href="nutrient-requirement-systems.html#background" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Deliberate animal feeding began before recorded history with the advent of agriculture in Asia and Africa 12,000 years ago <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Coffey2016" role="doc-biblioref">Coffey et al. 2016</a>)</span>. Primarily in the last 200 years, animal nutrition developed as a scientific discipline. The use of scientific methods enabled researchers to isolate the chemical components of feeds and to quantitatively relate dietary intakes to physiological effects. In the United States, nutrition science was spurred by the government in the aftermath of the Civil War and World Wars through the creation of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and its subsidiary organization the National Research Council [NRC; <span class="citation">Ullrey (<a href="#ref-Ullrey2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>]. NASEM is a non-governmental, non-profit organization of academics whose mission is to translate scientific information into domestic policy and practice.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Dairy nutrient requirement models<a href="nutrient-requirement-systems.html#dairy-nutrient-requirement-models" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In dairy nutrition, NRC and NASEM have contributed to the development of a series of editions of a volume entitled “Nutrient Requirements for Dairy Cattle.” The most recent edition (8th), hereafter referred to as NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> includes two parts. First, a 502 page consensus report describes advancements in the dairy nutrition literature in recent decades in the form of narrative text and prediction equations. Second, a software for Windows enables users to evaluate diet adequacy for a given scenario using the prediction equations given in the book.</p>
<p>The NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> predicts requirements of energy and major nutrients such as amino acids, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. It estimates separate requirements for different functions including maintenance, activity, growth, reproduction, lactation, and changes in body reserves, most often using a <strong>factorial</strong> approach <a href="nutrient-requirement-systems.html#def:factorial">2.1</a></p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:factorial" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.1  </strong></span>The factorial approach, in other words, means that separate calculations are done for each body function and then summed (e.g., maintenance requirement + gestation requirement + lactation requirement = total requirement).</p>
</div>
<p>It allows users to input target dry matter intake and milk production, or to use prediction equations to estimate the dry matter intake and milk production based on the diet and animal characteristics. This flexibility enables users to run the NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> model whether they have very detailed information about their herd (e.g., there are records for milk and component production, body weight, dry matter intake, average daily gain) or very limited information about their herd (e.g., there are limited records for input variables).</p>
<p>Nutrient requirement publications such as NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> typically contain both information about feed composition and information about animal requirements. Feed information is published in a series of feed tables that provide basic information about the chemical composition and physical properties of each feed ingredient. Animal requirements are presented as equations throughout the text which relate nutrient supplies to animal performance.</p>

<p>NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> is one of several dairy cattle nutrition requirement models. In most cases, models are intended to serve as decision support tools. In other words, the model estimates are intended to help dairy stakeholders, especially dairy farm managers, make more-informed decisions. The Cornell Net Protein and Carbohydrate System (CNCPS) is an alternative model upon which commercial ration formulation programs such as AMTS have been built. CNCPS also influence the development of The Large Ruminant Nutrition System (LRNS) by Texas A&amp;M researchers. In recent years, the importance of evaluating the environmental and economic impacts of dairy production have led to the development of models not just focused on the animal-level variables (as with NASEM), but instead integrating information about the entire farm system. These models, for example, the Ruminant Farm Systems (RuFaS) model, incorporate detailed information about local weather, soil characteristics, crop growth and storage, and prices of feedstuffs.</p>
<p>Some programs allow users to optimize the inclusion rate of selected diet ingredients (e.g., least cost ration formulation; AMTS program). In contrast, NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> is designed to <strong>evaluate</strong> existing diets rather than <strong>formulate</strong> new diets that optimize user-defined parameters or meet user-defined constraints. Additionally, NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> predicts selected environmental impacts at the individual animal, predominantly based on dietary factors. Thus, NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> predictions of environmental impacts do not integrate farm system information to the same extent as other models, e.g., RuFaS.</p>

<p>Previous editions of “Nutrient Requirements for Dairy Cattle” did not explicitly define the term <strong>nutrient requirement</strong>, but NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> includes an entire chapter delineating nutrient requirements and related terms. Much of this work is based on definitions used in human nutrition. NASEM’s Food and Nutrition Board in the Institute of Medicine <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-iom2006" role="doc-biblioref">Medicine (IOM) 2006</a>)</span> defined a series of terms outlining what <strong>nutrient requirement</strong> means in the human nutrition context. The dairy nutrition committee selected from these terms for use with dairy cattle.</p>
<p>The NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> book defines a nutrient requirement as <strong>“the daily amount of a nutrient necessary to meet a healthy animal’s needs for maintenance, activity, growth, reproduction, and lactation without any changes in body reserves or status”</strong> (NASEM, 2021, p. 4). Let’s break down each part of this definition.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>the daily amount of a nutrient</strong> - In human and animal nutrition, nutrient requirements are often given in amounts per day. Thus, a requirement is a rate of amount consumed per unit time. The use of “day” as the denominator is practical. Per hour is too short a timescale, because animals do not <em>require</em> nutrients every hour to maintain their health and functioning. Yet per week is too long, because an animal deprived of a certain nutrient would probably show symptoms associated with that nutrient deficiency. Additionally, most cattle rations are mixed and fed once or twice daily, so farm operators need to know the amounts to feed once or twice daily. Therefore, amount per day is a logical choice of timescale for expressing the requirements of most nutrients.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>a healthy animal’s needs</strong> - NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> acknowledges that illnesses alter the physiological state of animals such that they have different nutrition requirements. However, each illness alters nutrient requirements differently. The committee decided that there was insufficient data to predict requirements for unhealthy animals presently. As such, requirements are based on the assumption that the animal is healthy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>for maintenance, activity, growth, reproduction, and lactation without any changes in body reserves or status</strong> - This part explains that nutrient requirements are calculated to allow the animal to maintain various body functions without gaining or losing body reserves (e.g., losing fat or muscle mass) or status (e.g., losing milk production). Therefore, a nutrient requirement is specific to a given animal and scenario.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="green">
<p><strong>Test Yourself: </strong>
How is the term <strong>nutrient requirement</strong> used colloquially, and how does this differ from its scientific definition?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="absorbed-and-metabolizable-amounts" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Absorbed and metabolizable amounts<a href="nutrient-requirement-systems.html#absorbed-and-metabolizable-amounts" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Before moving on, we need to add more detail to what is meant by <strong>the daily amount of a nutrient</strong>. We know that not all the energy and nutrients eaten by an animal can be actually used for the body functions listed above. This is because a fraction of the energy and nutrients is excreted in feces and urine, and another fraction is lost as gas and heat. When discussing requirements, NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> most often gives the amount of nutrient on a <strong>metabolizable</strong> basis. This means that when we define the daily amount of a nutrient required, we mean the amount that is actually available for the animal to use for body functions (metabolizable amount) rather than the total amount of intake (gross amount). This will be detailed in later chapters. Reporting requirements as metabolizable amounts applies to energy and most nutrients except minerals, which are considered on an <strong>absorbed</strong> basis. The committee most likely chose an absorbed basis for minerals due to data availability. Many mineral studies report the amount of circulating minerals in the blood (absorbed) and few studies analyze mineral content in excreta (feces and urine).</p>
<div class="orange">
<p><strong>Just for fun: </strong>
Check a human food label. Similar to reporting for dairy cattle nutrition, human nutrition labels typically show the amounts of metabolizable energy and nutrients.</p>

<div id="determination-of-nutrient-requirements" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Determination of nutrient requirements<a href="nutrient-requirement-systems.html#determination-of-nutrient-requirements" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>We know now that a nutrient requirement is the daily (metabolizable or absorbable) amount of a nutrient required to support an animal’s body functioning without changing body reserves and status. We also know that requirements are typically calculated factorially, e.g., separate requirements are estimated for maintenance, gestation, lactation, growth, and reserve gain and summed together to estimate the total nutrient requirement. Yet, what is the general approach to determining any given nutrient requirement?</p>
<p>In general, nutrient requirements are determined by experiments where different levels of a nutrient are fed and animals’ responses (e.g., bodyweight, milk production, reproductive performance) are observed. Let’s consider a hypothetical nutrient X. A single experiment might compare just a few levels (n = 2-6) of nutrient X and record the average response. Over time, more experiments are done. The data from multiple experiments can be combined through meta-analysis. Compared to an experiment that shows responses to just a few levels of nutrient X intakes, a meta-analysis can show animal responses across a large range of nutrient X intakes. Using data from the meta-analysis, researchers can plot animal performance at each level of nutrient X intake to determine the nutrient requirement.</p>
<div class="orange">
<p><strong>Pause and consider: </strong>
Assume you have the data to plot the volume of milk production (Y) at different levels of intake of nutrient X. How would you determine the required amount of nutrient X for each level of milk production?</p>
</div>
<p>There are several ways researchers have conceptualized nutrient requirements.</p>
<div id="breakpoint-analysis-or-broken-stick-response" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Breakpoint analysis or “broken-stick” response<a href="nutrient-requirement-systems.html#breakpoint-analysis-or-broken-stick-response" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>One way researchers have estimated requirements is by finding the bend in a “broken-stick” response curve.</p>
<p>Researchers such as __________ expected that when a nutrient
The broken stick model supposes the following: 1) When animals consume nutrient X at a level below their requirement,</p>
<p>The response to nutrient X increases linearly until the requirement of X is satisfied. When feeding nutrient X at or above its requirement, the response is flat.</p>

<p>A “broken-stick” response indicates that as soon as a sufficient level of the nutrient is provided, there is no additional response to providing more nutrient.</p>

<p>When discussing nutrient requirements, we often refer to the daily amount of nutrient required <strong>on average</strong>. Yet it is important to remember that requirements have not just an average (a mean), they also have variability around the average (variance). NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> explains that within a given group of animals at a particular life stage, the distribution of responses to nutrient intake includes predictable and unpredictable variation. Predictable sources of variation are factors with a known effect on the animal’s response to nutrient intake (e.g., stage of lactation, milk production, body weight). Conversely, unpredictable variation represents both random variation and unmeasured variation.</p>

<p>Considering the variance in nutrient requirements is especially important when it comes to avoiding reductions in performance due to nutrient deficiencies. For example, let’s imagine we have a population of lactating cows with a distribution of requirements that looks as shown below. We feed them the estimated average requirement (EAR), as shown with the vertical red line:</p>

<div class="green">
<p><strong>Test Yourself: </strong>
What proportion of the population is being underfed if nutrient intake is at the EAR?</p>
</div>
<p>When feeding the average requirement, we can see that about half the animals will be overfed, and half will be underfed the nutrient. Underfeeding nutrients is expected to worsen health and performance. For this reason, human and animal nutritionists often feed not the average requirement, but instead the average requirement plus a “safety factor.” In order to determine an appropriate safety factor, we need to know the variance in the requirement. For example, in human nutrition, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) refers to the EAR + two standard deviations (recall that standard deviation is a measure of variance).</p>

<div class="green">
<p><strong>Test Yourself: </strong>
What proportion of the population is being underfed if nutrient intake is at the RDA (EAR + 2 standard deviations)?</p>
</div>
<p>Because the RDA is set at 2 standard deviations above the EAR, when feeding at the RDA, only a small proportion (2-3%) of the population is being underfed. The majority (97-98%) of the population is being fed an adequate amount. This illustrates how nutritionists need to know both the mean and variance of a nutrient requirement to make informed decisions about the amount to feed.</p>

<p>For dairy cattle, it is often preferable to overfeed nutrients than to underfeed. However, there are risks associated with overfeeding that nutritionists must guard against. For example, overfeeding energy could result in excessive body reserve gain leading to an increased risk of ketosis. Overfeeding the mineral selenium can cause acute toxicosis. Overfeeding crude protein is associated with reduced reproductive performance and (__________citation ) and an increase in negative environmental impacts.</p>
<p>In cases where toxicities have been observed and adequate data are available, NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> provides the <strong>maximum tolerable level (MTL)</strong> of a nutrient. At the MTL, research has shown that symptoms of toxicity begin to occur.
Vary in requirement. Keeping in mind that feeds vary in composition and animals vary in their requirements, nutritionists should aim to create rations that are sufficiently below the MTL to reduce the chances of toxicities.</p>

<p>Finally, NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> acknowledged that there are certain cases where insufficient data are available to determine the mean and variance for a nutrient requirement. In these cases, the committee makes an educated guess on an appropriate level for the nutrient requirement. The best guess for the requirement is referred to not as an EAR, but instead as an <strong>adequate intake (AI)</strong>. This distinction helps nutritionists determine whether the requirement has been determined after substantial experimental studies (EAR) or whether the requirement is an educated guess by the committee (AI).</p>
Putting it all together, we can see all of the dietary reference intakes discussed so far:

<p>Nutrient requirements can be expressed</p>
<p>When discussing nutrient requirements, it is important to remember tha</p>
<p>The NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> book defines a nutrient requirement as <strong>“the daily amount of a nutrient necessary to meet a healthy animal’s needs for maintenance, activity, growth, reproduction, and lactation without any changes in body reserves or status”</strong> (NASEM, 2021, p. 4). Let’s break down each part of this definition.</p>
<p>Nutrient requirements represent averages</p>
<p>Nutrient requirements are often discussed as fixed quantities. For example, we might say that a lactating cow requires</p>
<p>An additional complication to nutrient requirements</p>
<p>measurement error, stage of lactation, milk production, body weight,</p>
<p>Much of the variation in nutrient requirement depends on measured characteristics of the animal, i.e., the same information users typically enter as NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> inputs. This is predictable variation in requirement. However, even after removing the known sources of variation, individual animals still have slightly different requirements.</p>
<p>For example, let’s consider 10,000 hypothetical cows with exactly the same bodyweight, same production status, and same NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> input variables. If we enter all of this information into the NASEM model, it predicts that these 10,000 cows have exactly the same nutrient requirement. However, nutrient requirements have both deterministic (predictable) and stochastic (random) elements. In other words, we expect that the true population “requirements” are not a fixed value (e.g., 40), but instead are distributed in a bell-shape (e.g., 40 ± some measure of variation).</p>
<p>For this reason, NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> has begun to express requirements not just as the mean requirement, but also with a measure of variation.</p>
<p>NASEM <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NASEM8" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> is somewhat unclear about the specificity of a nutrient requirement. Based on the definitions given for humans specific to “gender and life stage”, it appears NASEM definitions may apply within breed (e.g., Holstein, Jersey) and class (e.g., lactating cow, dry cow, )</p>
<p>which predictable variation is</p>

<p>We do not have ALL NASEM inputs measured with each study, but the major ones are known. From this logic, we would take two dairy cattle with similar life stage (e.g., two heifers)</p>
<p>On the human side, requirements are given specific to gender and life stage. These are not the only variables affecting nutrient requirements that we know about. However, they are measured in most studies.</p>
