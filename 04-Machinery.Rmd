**Learning Objectives**

1.  List some of the "machinery" (mathematical operations) used in
    nutritional models.

2.  Discuss model descriptors such as empirical and mechanistic.

3.  Discuss limitations of nutritional models.

In the last chapter, we learned about some of the core parameters in the
NASEM model: supplies and requirements. In this chapter, we will roll up
our sleeves and look under the hood of the NASEM model to learn more
about other types of parameters beyond supplies and requirements. We
will also discuss some of the core mathematical concepts that underlie
the NASEM model functioning. The chapter is titled "Model machinery"
because it discusses some of the fundamental math that makes the NASEM
model work.

Nutrition involves primarily practical mathematical and statistical
problems. Animal nutritionists use nutritional modeling software to do
the "heavy lifting" for many types of calculations. We will consider
three categories of math and statistics that are used often by
nutritionists, as these also form the basis of many nutritional models.

1.  Basic mathematics
2.  Predictive models
3.  Optimization
