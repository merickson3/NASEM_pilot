Danes, Universidade Federal de Lavras 2023-04-08 Chapter 1 About this interactive textbook Figure 1.1: Cover of 'Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle, 8th edition' 1.1 Overview The NASEM (2021) \"Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle\" consensus report is a distillation of our collective knowledge about dairy cattle nutrition in the U.S. in the form of written text and mathematical equations. The most recent edition (8th), hereafter referred to as NASEM (2021), includes two parts. First, a 502 page consensus report book describes advancements in the dairy nutrition literature in recent decades in the form of narrative text and prediction equations. Second, a software for Windows enables users to evaluate diet adequacy for a given scenario based on the equations explained in the book. Our interactive textbook and its accompanying resources for teachers are intended to promote learning from the NASEM (2021) materials. Because the NASEM (2021) narrative and software were designed for advanced dairy nutrition practitioners, they may be difficult for less-experienced learners. Our interactive textbook is designed to highlight core concepts that will assist learners in understanding the NASEM narrative and utilizing the mathematical model in practice. Learning Objectives of this interactive textbook Raise learners' knowledge and confidence working with nutritional models, using the example of the NASEM (2021) \"Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle\" 1.2 Information for educators 1.3 Intended audience This interactive textbook is for anyone interested in learning about nutritional science and nutritional modeling. Although is discusses a dairy cattle nutritional model, it is NOT designed solely for dairy-interested learners. As the \"Requirements\" chapter illustrates, there is substantial overlap in how scientists describe nutritional processes for humans and other animal species. Throughout the textbook, we emphasized critical thinking about nutritional science rather than memorization of any particular dairy cattle nutrition facts. Therefore, we hope this interactive textbook will be interesting and relevant for learners regardless of their interest in dairy cattle. 1.4 Assumptions about prior knowledge This textbook can be used by anyone, but it has been designed with the assumption that learners have some prior knowledge. Before starting this material, we suggest that learners should have: Intermediate understanding of nutritional physiology of ruminants, e.g., have taken an animal nutrition course Intermediate knowledge of dairy production systems, e.g., through an introductory animal science or management-focused course, or through personal/career-related experiences Basic skills with statistics and math (mean, standard deviation, regression) 1.5 Technology requirements To read the narrative and complete activities, need a computer and stable internet connection To run NASEM-8 software, need Windows operating system 1.6 Accessing the NASEM (2021) book The NASEM (2021) book provides a narrative that summarizes recent scientific literature on dairy nutrition and justifies choices made while developing the mathematical model. The narrative is rich with information on nutritional physiology, dairy herd management, dairy nutrition experimentation, and the model development process. Due to its information density and use of technical language, it may be overwhelming to read for less-experienced practitioners. For this reason, learners may find it helpful to read the NASEM (2021) book in a class or small-group setting where it is possible to ask questions and verify their understanding. Instructors and learners can work together to determine which sections of the text are appropriate to the learners' current comprehension level. For intermediate learners, it may be best to read this interactive textbook first before spending much time reading the NASEM (2021) narrative. Advanced learners may be able to read through the NASEM (2021) Consensus Report simultaneous to completing the activities in it. In some cases, learners may benefit from approaching the narrative in an informal \"Journal Club\"-style setting (arranged either by teachers or students!). Accessing NASEM (2021) consensus report At the time of writing, a print version of the NASEM 8th edition book is available for purchase at the link below. Eventually this material will be available to read for free online. https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25806/nutrient-requirements-of-dairy-cattle-eighth-revised-edition Earlier editions, e.g., 7th, NRC (2001) Earlier editions of \"Nutrient Requirements for Dairy Cattle\" are available to read for free online, for example, the 7th edition (2001): https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/9825/nutrient-requirements-of-dairy-cattle-seventh-revised-edition-2001 1.7 The NASEM-dairy-8 software Most of this interactive textbook can be completed without using the NASEM-dairy-8 software. However, learners are encouraged to download and experiment with the NASEM dairy-8 software on their own time. Download instructions are available on the NASEM website. The NASEM dairy-8 software runs only on Windows operating system. Learners who wish to run NASEM dairy-8 can install it on a personal computer or a campus library computer. Learners with non-Windows operating system may be able to download the NASEM dairy-8 using virtual machines through platforms such as Virtual Box (https://www.virtualbox.org). However, this requires substantial computer expertise and may be inconvenient for everyday use. Accessing NASEM-dairy-8 software The NASEM-dairy-8 software for Windows is available to download as shown here: https://nap.nationalacademies.org/resource/25806/Installation_Instructions_NASEM_Dairy8.pdf Earlier software, e.g., NASEM-dairy-7 It is also possible to download the Windows software for NRC (2001), although NASEM recommendeds against having both NRC 2001 and NASEM 2021 software installed on the same computer. https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/9825/nutrient-requirements-of-dairy-cattle-seventh-revised-edition-2001 1.8 Running a simulation The easiest way to get started running NASEM-8 is to Load a pre-defined simulation.The software comes with several pre-defined simulations for different classes of animals (e.g., \"Example Lactating Cow 100 DIM\"). Loading a pre-defined simulation pre-loads all of the inputs describing an example animal, management scenario, and diet. This can be helpful to avoid entering unrealistic inputs. To run NASEM-8, users proceed through four sections: Inputs. In the first panel, users must specify the Program Settings. Most commonly, the default settings (Metric, Dry Matter) can be retained. In the second panel of Inputs, \"Animal Description/Management\" users can provide detail about the animal (e.g., age, breed, days in milk) and the management scenario (e.g., grazing vs. no grazing). Finally, the \"Production\" panel allows users to specify the expected rates of growth, changes in body reserves, and milk and component production. Feeds. In this section, users can select the feedstuffs that will comprise the ration (\"Add Feeds to Ration\"). The software is pre-loaded with a default Feed Library, which contains composition information for over 300 feeds commonly used in dairy rations. Ingredients in the feed library can be modified to create custom feeds (\"Edit feed components and nutrients\"), which users can save to the feed library (Save Feed in Feed Library) for later use. This section defines which feeds are used in the ration, but not the inclusion rates. Ration. Feeds selected in the prior section will appear in the Ration List. To create a ration, users enter either the amount of dry matter (DM) consumed or the feed's percent of total diet DM. The bottom of the screen allows users to specify DMI manually (\"Total Intake\") or to select from two estimated intakes produced by the NASEM model using the animal characteristics (e.g., milk production, parity, body weight). Using the \"Set to 100%\" allows users to easily scale diet information to 100%. This can be helpful to correct rounding errors (e.g., to fix ingredient composition that sums to 100.01 or 99.99% of DM). A sidebar shows quick estimates of the diet nutritional value, which makes it easier to tweak the ingredient composition to meet goals. Reports. Finally, users can generate reports detailing the predictions from the NASEM (2021) model. Nine types of reports are available. By selecting \"10. All\" and \"Generate Selected Reports,\" a Word document is created and opened. Users can look through the Word document to see predicted nutrient supplies and requirements associated with their inputs. It is also possible to generate an excel spreadsheet with the nutrient composition of ingredients. This may be helpful for users who wish to do their own manual calculations. Some of the most common mistakes when using NASEM dairy-8 relate to improper inputs. For example, a user could enter a body weight of 7,000 instead of 700 kg in the Animal Description; or create a custom feed with unrealistic nutrient composition. For this reason, it is easiest to use pre-loaded simulations and default Feed Library ingredients in classroom settings. This will prevent many hours of troubleshooting related to improper inputs. NOTE: Even with perfectly-matched inputs, the NASEM software is more up-to-date than the consensus report. For this reason, the outputs may differ slightly when using equations in the book versus the reports generated in the software. More details are given in the next section. 1.9 Known updates (discrepancies in book vs. software) The software is under continual improvement, whereas the book is static. According to the NASEM-8 software \"help\" documentation, the latest software and R code contains the most correct and up-to-date version of the NASEM model. To avoid confusion, our interactive textbook will use the NASEM model equations given in the software. 1.9.1 NASEM dairy-8 software updates and bugs Since the software was released, several updates have been made. Users should ensure they have the latest version of NASEM-8 downloaded to avoid any errors. The errors below may be encountered with older versions: With versions of NASEM-8 software downloaded prior to 2023.03.11, user-entered target milk production, milk protein production, and milk fat were silently overridden with predicted values. This resulted in NEL, urine energy, and other values reported incorrectly. This bug has been fixed by the developer in subsequent releases. In certain cases, the NEL balance in the sidebar does not match the Word document output. In certain versions of the NASEM-8 software, manure volatile solids was overwritten by manure water in tabular output in Word. 1.9.2 Differences between the book and software The most recent software is more up-to-date than the equations in the Consensus Report book. Most discrepancies result in relatively small differences in predictions as a result of fine-tuning parameters. Known discrepancies between the book and software include: The kg of CP in gravid uterus per kg of calf birth weight (CP_GrUtWt) differs from book p. 87. The kg gravid uterus weight per fetal birthweight (GrUterWt_FetBWbrth) differs from book p. 31. The energy (Mcal/kg) fresh gravid uterus weight (NE_GrUtWt) at birth differs from book p. 31. The amount of CP (kg/kg) in fresh gravid uterus weight (CP_GrUtWt) differs from book p. 87. The coefficient for digestible energy in urinary nitrogen differs from the book (p. 32?). Estimated manure output (Man_out) uses a different equation than those listed in the Environment chapter. The coefficient for NDF in the methane emission equation for heifers is positive in the book (p. 302), and negative in the software. The intercept for the methane production of non-lactating dairy cows is positive in the book (p. 302; 14-1c) and negative in the software. Additionally, note that CF is crude fat, not crude fiber! In the book (eq. 13-4, p. 304) the CP:N factor is listed as 0.638. It is 0.634 (6.34) in the software. The 6.34 factor is consistent with the Protein chapter. Other notes (not discrepant, but maybe helpful to know). 1. The book (eq. 6-13b, p. 87) gives an equation for the efficiency of AA use for non-pregnant animals. There is no corresponding equation for gestating animals in the book, but the software takes into account AA needs for gestation when appropriate. 1. The book (eq. 6-4a) has a parentheses error. The end of the equation shows a calculation of total diet NDF intake as NDF/100 * DMI. The diet NDF intake should be multiplied by the entire equation preceding, not just the last term (1.51 * DMI). This is because the first part of the equation calculates the percentage of rumen-degradable NDF out of the diet NDF. 1.10 Contribute edits and suggestions Interested in editing or adding to this interactive textbook?

List and differentiate common dairy nutritional models. Describe how nutritional models are developed, step-by-step. 2.1 A brief history Deliberate animal feeding began before recorded history with the advent of agriculture in Asia and Africa 12,000 years ago (Coffey, 2016). Since this time, humans have carefully considered how to manage forages, grains, minerals, and other natural resources to provide nourishment for domesticated animals. In regions throughout the world, traditional and indigenous knowledge systems contain a wealth of information on animal nutritional management, yet very little of it is recorded in publications and books. Primarily in the last 200 years, animal nutrition developed as a scientific discipline. The use of scientific methods enabled researchers to isolate the chemical components of feeds and to quantitatively relate dietary intakes to physiological effects. As nutrition science progressed, nutritional diseases that had once harmed or killed thousands of animals (and people) began to be curable. The productivity of agricultural animals began to increase. As per the scientific method, advances were recorded with detailed publications in the scientific literature to enable cumulative progress. In the United States, nutrition science was spurred by government efforts to reconstruct and reduce poverty after wars. In the aftermath of the Civil War and World Wars, the U.S. government chartered the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and its subsidiary organization the National Research Council (NRC, Ullrey, 2001). NASEM is a non-governmental, non-profit organization of academics whose mission is to translate scientific information into domestic policy and practice. In animal nutrition, NASEM is famous for organizing efforts to consolidate nutritional science knowledge into animal feeding recommendations by publishing consensus reports. The first edition of \"Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle\" was published by the NRC (NASEM's subsidiary) in 1945. In the eight decades following, researchers created seven more editions of this consensus report. Each edition uses the most up-to-date research on dairy cattle nutrition generated by researchers at universities and government institutions. Test yourself The 7th edition is the most recent version of the Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle. TRUEFALSE The National Academies publishes consensus reports for other species besides dairy cattle. TRUEFALSE 2.2 Definition Test Yourself: Before proceeding, we need to ask ourselves...what are nutritional models, and what do they have in common with the cave paintings shown at the beginning of the chapter? The cave painting of cattle is a two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional animals. It conveys some information about cattle and how they are shaped. Although we cannot know the intention of its artist(s), perhaps they meant to use the cave painting to communicate some information about cattle they had observed. The painting is a \"snapshot\" in time that summarizes and communicates about cattle. A nutritional model (for example, the NASEM dairy model) is also a representation of cattle. Instead of a two-dimensional artwork, nutritional models are generally represented mathematically. The tens or hundreds of mathematical expressions that comprise a nutritional model are intended to summarize and communicate what we know about cattle nutrition. Similar to the painting, a model is a representation of reality. 2.3 Usefulness Models are mathematical and/or statistical descriptions of inputs, processes, and outputs. Nutritional models function as decision-support tools that can use known information (e.g., feed composition, animal characteristics) to predict how nutritional processes will unfold and what outcomes will result. They can be used to answer various types of questions. Scenario 1 A dairy nutritionist has access to many different feedstuffs with known chemical composition. They have several different pens of animals to feed (e.g., calves, dry cows, lactating cows, high-producing lactating cows). How do they create diets for each pen of animals? A nutritional model can help determine the requirements for each pen of animals. Additionally, the nutritional model can determine which feeds can be combined to create diets that meet the requirements. Scenario 2 A group of dairy producers aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their farm so they can reach carbon-neutral production goals. How can they select diets that contribute to their environmental goals? A nutritional model could help these producers predict the environmental impact of their current production practices, or explore hypothetical alternative diets and scenarios. Scenario 3 A dairy nutritionist has a suspicion that a group of cows is not producing as much milk fat as they could be, given the diet and animal characteristics. How does the nutritionist test their hypothesis? A nutritional model can be used to benchmark production. Benchmarking means comparing the observed value against a reference value to evaluate its adequacy. In this case, the nutritionist could enter the diet and cow information to predict the expected milk fat production under these conditions. Then, they could compare this reference (expected) value to their observed value to benchmark. Scenario 4 Feed costs for certain ingredients have changed, and a nutritionist wants to ensure they can meet animal needs and maintain performance at the least possible cost. How can they create a diet that minimizes feed costs? A nutritional model can be used to optimize diets based on certain constraints. For example, least cost formulation is a common approach. It involves finding the combination of ingredients that will create a diet that meets animal requirements and costs the least amount. 2.4 NASEM (2021) and other dairy nutrition models NASEM is one of several dairy cattle nutrition models. In most cases, models are intended to serve as decision support tools. In other words, the model estimates are intended to help dairy stakeholders, especially dairy farm managers, make more-informed decisions. The Cornell Net Protein and Carbohydrate System (CNCPS) is an alternative model upon which commercial ration formulation programs such as AMTS have been built. CNCPS also influence the development of The Large Ruminant Nutrition System (LRNS) by Texas A&amp;M researchers. In recent years, the importance of evaluating the environmental and economic impacts of dairy production have led to the development of models not just focused on the animal-level variables (as with NASEM), but instead integrating information about the entire farm system. These models, for example, the Ruminant Farm Systems (RuFaS) model, incorporate detailed information about local weather, soil characteristics, crop growth and storage, and prices of feedstuffs. Some programs allow users to optimize the inclusion rate of selected diet ingredients (e.g., least cost ration formulation; AMTS program). In contrast, NASEM is designed to evaluate existing diets rather than formulate new diets that optimize user-defined parameters or meet user-defined constraints. Additionally, NASEM predicts selected environmental impacts at the individual animal, predominantly based on dietary factors. Thus, NASEM predictions of environmental impacts do not integrate farm system information to the same extent as other models, e.g., RuFaS.

To get a sense of how nutritional models work, let's go through a fictional example and develop our own (very simple!) nutritional model. We need to follow the following steps: Hypothesis generation Data collection (through observation and experimentation) Model development Model verification and generation of new hypotheses ...repeat the process ad infinitum 2.5.1 Hypothesis generation Imagine that a researcher has some cattle in individual stalls. They ensure each cow has as much feed as she wants to consume (ad libitum feeding). Over time, the researcher starts to notice that the larger cattle seem to eat more. They write this observation into their notebook. What the researcher has just done is the rough beginning of generating a hypothesis: Larger cows seem to consume more feed than smaller cows. After thinking about it some more, they can refine their hypothesis to make it more testable. For example, rather than \"larger cows\", which is somewhat vague, they can be more specific and say \"greater bodyweight.\" Rather than saying \"eat more,\" they can say \"consume more dry matter on a daily basis.\" Now, we have a testable hypothesis: In lactating cows, greater bodyweight is associated with greater dry matter intake on a daily basis. By gathering empirical data, we can test this hypothesis. If we find evidence that this relationship is true, we can use it to build a nutritional model. 2.5.2 Data collection through observation (or experimentation) To learn more about the hypothesized relationship between body size and feed intake, the researcher decides to find a larger group of cattle to collect observational data. They collect two pieces of information in each observation: 1) the animal's body weight (BW), and 2) the animal's dry matter intake (DMI). They use the data to create a plot: Figure 2.2: DMI vs BW for 300 observations from lactating cows Think to Yourself: What would you conclude from the plot? After looking at the plot, the researcher believes that it supports their hypothesis: DMI and BW are positively related. In other words, if an animal's BW is known, its DMI can be guessed with some accuracy. The researcher decides to convert this observed relationship to a mathematical model. Because the relationship seems to follow a line, they fit a regression with the linear form \\(y = mx + b\\). Figure 2.3: Fitted regression model predicting DMI from BW for lactating cows 2.5.3 Model development By fitting a regression model to the observed points, they get an estimate of the slope (0.03) that relates BW and DMI. In other words, the average DMI observed was 3% of the animal BW. This single mathematical expression is a very simple nutritional model: \\(DMI = 0.03 * BW\\) We can think of our example model as an expression relating three parameters: \\(DMI\\) a predicted value \\(0.03\\) a coefficient relating DMI and BW \\(BW\\) a user input describing the animal The researcher thinks the model will be useful for prediction. They decide to test the predictive performance of the model by buying a new lactating cow. They record the cow's BW as 625 kg. Figure 2.4: Fitted regression model predicting DMI from BW for lactating cows Test Yourself: Using our simple nutritional model, what is this cow's predicted DMI? 2.5.4 Model verification To predict the DMI of the new cow, the researcher enters the known information (cow's BW) into the nutritional model: \\(DMI = 0.03 * 625\\). The model predicts the cow's DMI will be 18.75 kg. Tracing up from the x-axis, the intersection of the red dashed line with the blue line shows the predicted DMI for an animal with BW = 625. Next, the researcher decides to verify their model by measuring the animal's actual DMI. Figure 2.5: Actual DMI for a new observation (red point) of a cow with BW = 625 kg Uh oh.... the actual DMI observed is shown with the large red point. It is greater than the prediction. This means that the model under-predicted the actual DMI for this cow based on her BW. This causes the researcher to go back to their original model, \\(DMI = 0.03 * BW\\). The variable BW seems to explain some, but not all of the variation in DMI. Test Yourself: What should the researcher do next? There are several courses of action to be considered. First, the researcher could leave the model as-is, and attribute the error in prediction to un-explainable variation. Un-explainable variation comes from unknown and un-measurable sources, including the intrinsic randomness of the universe. Second, the researcher could try to gather more information to find other measurable predictors of DMI besides BW. Then, they could revise the nutritional model to include other variables that determine the DMI. 2.5.5 Model refinement (re-starting the process) Generally, scientists take the second option. In our example, the researcher might go back to their notebook and consider... what other factors could be affecting DMI aside from BW? Eventually, they would develop a new hypothesis, for example: younger, first-lactation animals will consume less than more mature animals with two or more lactations. They plot the data again, including information about the animals' parity: Figure 2.6: DMI vs BW for 300 observations from lactating cows, by parity It appears there is some variation explained by parity. In this way, the researcher can update the model to include other parameters, e.g., \\(DMI = 0.03 * BW + ParityEffect\\). Our example model now includes four parameters: \\(DMI\\) a predicted value \\(0.03\\) a coefficient relating DMI and BW \\(BW\\) a user input describing the animal \\(ParityEffect\\) a parameter that adjusts the intercept up for multiparous, and down for primiparous cows. When it comes to updating our model from here, the possibilities are almost limitless. Parameters can refer to any part of the animal system: the model inputs, intermediates, outputs, and relationships among these quantities. Almost anything we can measure in animal nutrition (an amount, a rate, a status) can be thought of as a parameter. As we can see from the example, parameters are not always numeric. Inputs such as \\(Parity = multiparous, primiparous\\), \\(Breed = Holstein\\), and \\(Life\\space Stage = Calf\\) are categories rather than numbers. As we'll see in later chapters, nutritional models can accommodate many different types of information (e.g, numerical, categorical), various types of relationships between parameters (e.g., additive, interactive), using many types of mathematical expressions (e.g., linear, non-linear). 2.5.6 Reflecting on our example model Congratulations - you created and used your first nutritional model! 🎉 Just like the two-dimensional cow paintings at the beginning, our simple nutritional model conveyed some information about cattle. Instead of a painting, we used a mathematical expression to communicate it. We showed how a researcher could use empirical observations (data collection) to create a model expression, check it against new data, and refine the model. 2.6 Scaling up and adding complexity How do we get from our simple example model, to a huge and complex model like NASEM? In our example, one researcher was working alone. In actuality, thousands of animal nutritionists and researchers contribute to developing nutritional models such as NASEM (2021). Many researchers have a specific focus area (e.g., fatty acid nutrition, rumen function) and dedicate their efforts to improving methods and collecting data for this specific topic area. An individual researcher can only collect a limited amount of data on a few parameters. Still, when thousands of researchers publish their findings, these models and data can be aggregated into larger models. In fact, some researchers (\"modelers\") specialize in aggregating and modeling data collected by other scientists! The NASEM model is a conglomeration of many smaller models (sometimes called sub-models) into one larger model. The entire NASEM model is massive: it represents all nutrients and energy for all nutritional processes. It contains hundreds of parameters, related by many types of mathematical expressions. In contrast, any given piece (a sub-model) of the NASEM model is simpler. A sub-model could represent only one nutrient (e.g., protein) or a specific process (e.g., ruminal degradation). Many of the sub-models can be further divided into smaller sub-models. Each of these tiny pieces of the NASEM model was created and refined through scientific processes similar to our example model. Modelers worked to connect together these tiny sub-models to create the much larger NASEM model. Test yourself A NASEM sub-model is someone else's duplicate of the original model. TRUEFALSE 2.7 Conclusion Nutritional models serve practical goals: they can make animal feeding practices more economical, more environmentally-sound, and more aligned with human needs and available resources. Nutritional models are developed through scientific processes. They use mathematical expressions to represent information about how nutritional processes work. Nutritional models can appear quite complex, but it's important to remember that they are the collective effort of many people, across long periods of time, as documented in the scientific literature. 2.8 R code for figures R code used for this chapter is given below. # Set the seed for reproducibility set.seed(765) # Load required packages library(dplyr) library(magrittr) library(ggplot2) # Set the ggplot2 theme theme_set(theme_bw()) # Generate data res &lt;- rnorm(300, 0, sd = 3) # generate normally distributed residuals bw &lt;- rnorm(300, 600, sd = 40) # generate normally distributed body weights parity &lt;- rep(c(1, 7), 150) # generate parity effect using integers dmi &lt;- 0.03 * bw + parity + res # create dry matter intake (DMI) as a function of observed and residual # Create a data frame with the generated data ,create parity values df &lt;- data.frame(DMI = dmi, BW = bw, Parity = parity) %&gt;% mutate( Parity = ifelse( Parity == 1, &quot;Primiparous (first calf)&quot;, &quot;Multiparous (2+ calves)&quot; ) ) # Create a scatterplot of BW and DMI p &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = BW, y = DMI)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;BW, kg&quot;, y = &quot;DMI, kg/d&quot;) p + theme_bw() # Add a linear regression line to the scatterplot and label the equation p + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = F) + annotate( geom = &quot;text&quot;, x = 540, y = 35, label = &quot;DMI = 0.03*BW&quot;, color = &quot;blue&quot;, size = 5 ) + theme_bw() + labs(x = &quot;BW, kg&quot;, y = &quot;DMI, kg/d&quot;) # Create a scatterplot of BW and DMI, with an additional vertical red dashed line p2 &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = BW, y = DMI)) + geom_point(color = &quot;grey&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = F) + annotate( geom = &quot;text&quot;, x = 540, y = 35, label = &quot;DMI = 0.03*BW&quot;, color = &quot;blue&quot;, size = 5 ) + annotate( geom = &quot;segment&quot;, x = 625, xend = 625, y = -Inf, yend = Inf, color = &quot;red&quot;, lty = &quot;dashed&quot; ) + theme_bw() + labs(x = &quot;BW, kg&quot;, y = &quot;DMI, kg/d&quot;) p2 # Add a red point to the scatterplot p2.1 &lt;- p2 + annotate( geom = &quot;point&quot;, x = 625, y = 25, size = 4, color = &quot;red&quot; ) + theme_bw() p2.1 # Create a scatterplot of BW and DMI, with color based on parity, and label the linear regression lines p &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = BW, y = DMI, color = Parity)) + geom_point() + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) p + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = F) + annotate( geom = &quot;text&quot;, x = 555, y = 35, label = &quot;DMI = 0.03*BW + (multiparous effect)&quot;, color = &quot;#F8766D&quot;, size = 5 ) + annotate( geom = &quot;text&quot;, x = 555, y = 32, label = &quot;DMI = 0.03*BW + (primiparous effect)&quot;, color = &quot;#00BFC4&quot;, size = 5 ) + labs(x = &quot;BW, kg&quot;, y = &quot;DMI, kg/d&quot;) "],["systems-concepts.html", "Chapter 3 Systems concepts 3.1 The animal nutritional system 3.2 Ways of understanding nutritional systems 3.3 Systems concepts 3.4 Single-animal nutritional system 3.5 Physical/chemical principles: Mass &amp; energy balance 3.6 Biological principles: ordered processes 3.7 Biological principles: context-dependence 3.8 Conclusions", " Chapter 3 Systems concepts Figure 3.1: Simplified representation of animal nutrition as a system Learning Objectives Map out the basic structure and boundaries of a single-animal nutritional system, using systems thinking concepts. Explain physical/chemical and biological principles that apply across animal nutrition. Give specific examples of 1) inputs, 2) outputs, and 3) means by which the system is transformed for a dairy ruminant. 3.1 The animal nutritional system In the last chapter, we created a simple nutritional model that represented three pieces of information: feed intake, body weight, and parity. Yet as animal scientists, we have access to much more information about feeds, animals, and outcomes than just these three variables. As we start to build more complex models that include more variables, we will quickly confront a problem...how can we organize the many different pieces of information we can collect about an animal's nutrition? In this chapter, we will begin to think about the animal as a nutritional system. Specifically, we will consider the boundaries of nutritional knowledge, discuss guiding principles, and sketch out the configuration of a single-animal nutritional system, using dairy cattle examples. 3.2 Ways of understanding nutritional systems Disciplines such as physics, economics, and animal nutrition each have their own ways of seeing the world. Animal nutrition is an applied discipline, so nutritionists make use of tools from various other disciplines to achieve practical goals. For a nutritionist, the most interesting aspects of an animal are the physical, chemical, and biological processes through which the organism intakes nutrients uses them to support its life. Physical properties can be observed or measured without changing the composition of the substance. For example, freezing water changes its physical properties, but not its chemical composition. In contrast, chemical changes involve the substance reacting with other substances to change chemical composition. Finally, biological processes involve both physics and chemistry, and they are enacted in a living organism. In practice, animal nutritionists manage many different aspects of animal systems, including social and economic components. For example, a dairy nutritionist in California might formulate rations that include lots of almond hulls, because this is a cheap feed source (economic) that is a byproduct of a process that humans value (social). A nutritionist might change the ingredient composition of diets based on the desire of some people for grass-fed milk (social). A nutritional model such as NASEM (2021) does not take into account economic or social factors. It is based solely on physical, chemical, and biological properties of the animal system. Ways of knowing represented in nutritional practice, versus nutritional models. Discipline Nutrition in Practice Nutritional Model Physical X X Chemical X X Biological X X Social X Economic X Nutrition is life itself! If you've ever known an animal you truly loved, you might be thinking - an animal is more than just a nutritional system! This is true. Yet from the nutritionist's perspective, the biochemical processes of digestion and metabolism form the core of life itself. The animal's abilities to keep living, to grow, to move, to change, to reproduce, and to make milk are all outcomes of nutritional processes. 3.3 Systems concepts Let's start building our understanding of a single-animal nutritional system. A single animal nutritional system is centered on the body of one animal. However, the boundaries of the system are not the body of the animal per se, because our nutritional system includes both the animal's body and the digesta in the gastrointestinal tract. Collectively, we will call the body and digesta the animal. The animal is an open system--it interacts with its environment through inputs and outputs rather than being closed off to external forces. In our single animal nutritional system, the major inputs are the energy and nutrients in feed. Through the processes of digestion and metabolism, the inputs are transformed into various intermediates. Finally, the nutritional system has outputs such as milk, feces, urine, heat, and activity. Of course, the lives of animals unfold over time. Consequently, nutritional systems occur over time. This temporal aspect adds some complications for developing nutritional models. To simplify, we often assume that a nutritional system is in a steady state condition, or in other words, in dynamic equilibrium. A system in steady state has inputs flowing in, and outputs flowing out, without the state of the system itself changing. For example, a mature animal that is not lactating or growing may have relatively stable nutritional system. In contrast, systems can move through transient states where the system itself is undergoing changes. For example, as a young animal grows, their nutritional system is constantly transforming. Still, sometimes these transformations are small enough to ignore over a short period of time (e.g., the growth of a calf over 4 days). Because nutritional systems are dynamic, we almost always discuss their inputs, processes, and outputs in terms of rates (amounts per period of time) rather than amounts. However, as an additional simplification, we typically assume the denominator of the rate is one day in models such as NASEM. For example, we record the rate of dry matter intake (DMI, kg/d) and the rate of milk output (kg/d) in dairy nutritional trials. We can even model changes to the system itself one day at a time. For example, we can predict the nutrients required (amount per one day) for a calf to grow in body size (amount per one day). 3.4 Single-animal nutritional system A few guiding principles are true across nearly all animal nutritional models. These principles inform the basic structure of the nutritional model and are considered by researchers throughout the processes of model development. These rules are core assumptions in animal nutrition that we will see repeated throughout the NASEM model. 3.5 Physical/chemical principles: Mass &amp; energy balance Based on the laws of thermodynamics, we know that matter and energy are neither created nor destroyed. Because we know mass and energy will be conserved, we can start to develop rules about our single animal nutritional system. These very simple rules will help us represent the nutritional system in mathematical terms. At steady state, the flow (Q) of energy or mass into the system equals the flow out of the system: \\[ Q_{Input} = Q_{Output} \\] At a transient state, the flow of energy or mass into the system equals the flow out, plus the flow into transforming the system itself at a given point in time. Transformations can involve accumulation (positive) or decumulation (negative) of energy and matter into the system. \\[ Q_{Input} = Q_{Output} + Q_{Transformation} \\] The laws of thermodynamics are universal, so we can apply these rules to the flow of energy, or to the flow of any element (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) across the system. When applied to dairy cattle nutrition, input flows relate primarily to feed consumption. Elements and energy flow out of the animal in milk, feces, urine, and gas. Energy is transferred during movement and heat loss. Transformation flows occur when the animal's body grows, gains or loses tissues associated with reproduction, or gains or loses body reserves. Figure 3.2: Representation of animal nutrition as a system, showing examples for each category of flows Test yourself An animal was fed some feed containing 400 g/d of phosphorus (P). Later, the researcher analyzed the outputs (feces and urine) from the animal and recovered 350 g/d of P. Was this animal apparently at a steady state, or a transient state? How do you know? transient statesteady state For math appreciators If you are a math appreciator, you may notice some opportunities to use systems of differential equations to answer nutritional questions. 3.6 Biological principles: ordered processes Nutritional systems involve many different processes from macroscopic to microscopic scales. For any nutrient and for energy, nutritional models typically describe a core sequence of nutritional processes: Ingestion - the input of nutrients, energy, and water to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Digestion - the mechanical and chemical breakdown of larger molecules into smaller substances that can be absorbed (e.g., fatty acids, amino acids, glucose, ammonia). Absorption - the passage of molecules into the body itself (into circulation) rather than remaining in the gastrointestinal tract. Assimilation and Use - at the cellular level, the use of nutrients and energy in chemical reactions that sustain life and body functions. Associated with output and transformation processes. These nutritional processes can also be thought of as a set of rules. For example, a nutrient or energy must be ingested before it can be digested, absorbed, assimilated, or used. Therefore, we know that the gross amount ingested is always greater than the amount digested. The amount digested is greater than the amount available for metabolism. Finally, the amount available for metabolism is greater than the net amount used in output and transformation processes. When energy and nutrients are mobilized from body reserves, they have already passed through the processes of ingestion, digestion, and absorption. Similarly, in nutrition trials where small-molecules are infused into the bloodstream or distal gastrointestinal tract, these nutrients \"skip ahead\" of ingestion and digestion. 3.7 Biological principles: context-dependence The laws of thermodynamics and other physical/chemical rules are fairly universal--they hold true across many contexts. The same core processes of nutrition can be found across the Animalia kingdom. This gives us the basic configuration of a nutritional system that will be true across different types of animals. But beyond this, the structure and behavior of nutritional systems is dependent on the context. For example, imagine the nutritional system of a lactating, high-producing Holstein fed a high-quality ration, versus that of a dry heifer fed a diet based on poor-quality forage. The principles of mass balance and the order of nutritional processes apply to both. Yet, we expect the specific behavior of the nutritional system will be vary between these two contexts. Therefore, our final guiding principle states that the structure and behavior of nutritional systems is context-dependent. Elements of the context such as breed, genetics, production system, geographic region, etc., determine how the system functions. Sometimes, aspects of the context can be represented in nutritional models, as we will see in the NASEM model. 3.8 Conclusions With these guiding principles, we can sketch out a rough outline of the configuration of a single-animal nutritional system for any nutrient or for energy. We know that our system will have inputs, outputs, and the potential to transform itself. We know that the system functions through core nutritional processes from ingestion to assimilation and use. We know that the specifics of the system behavior depend on contextual factors. Figure 3.3: Representation of animal nutrition as a system, showing the overarching effects of contextual factors Although we have made progress in establishing the basic configuration of a nutritional system, we want to be able to answer practical questions! For example: Does this diet supply enough minerals to support the growth and development of a 3-month old calf? How much dietary protein will it take to support the process of uterine involution in a postpartum cow? For an animal walking 1000 meters to the parlor each day, how much extra energy is required? These questions require us to characterize the system in greater detail. In the subsequent chapters, we will discuss nutritional inputs, processes, and outputs in much greater detail. We will delineate which contextual factors have the greatest impact on nutritional system behavior. By the end, you will be able to use a nutritional model (NASEM) to predict how inputs will be split up into specific outputs (e.g., what amount of nutrient X will appear in milk, urine, feces) or used in system transformation. Test yourself Think about the illustration below showing how marbles flow through a series of blocks. Can you draw an analogy to mass balance? A) Discuss input, output, and transformation (accumulation) in terms of marbles flowing in and out of this system. B) In this system, what happens during steady state, and transient state conditions? In this system, all the marbles enter the same way. What determines where the marbles leave the system (which color tunnel) or where they get stuck in the system? If you're losing your marbles, you can click below to see one interpretation of this marble sorter as a system. Show an explanation Marbles are input at the top of the system and output at the bottom when they leave the blocks. A system transformation occurs when a marble gets stuck somewhere in the system, because it changes the form of the system and its reaction to new inputs. Steady state conditions would involve inputs equalling the outputs. In other words, the number of marbles in would equal the number of marbles out for a given period of time. Transient state conditions would involve the accumulation or decumulation of marbles, where the flow of inputs would not equal the flow of outputs. In this system, the fates of marbles are determined by what blocks they run into, and possibly other factors such as the weight and size of the marble.

Learning Objectives Define a nutrient requirement in precise terms. Explain how nutrient requirements are determined through experimentation. List and discuss limitations of typical conceptions of “requirement” 4.1 Defining nutrient flows 4.1.1 Supplies, requirements, and balances As we read earlier, nutritional models can be used for many different purposes. However, the core of a model like NASEM is its ability to predict two sets of parameters: supplies and requirements. In order to design diets that support the animal's needs for a healthy, productive life, the nutritionist needs to know both sides: the amount of nutrients that the diet supplies, and also the amount that is required by the animal given its physiological state and production characteristics. Having information about both supplies and requirements allows a nutritionist to evaluate the adequacy of a diet with respect to the animal needs. For a given nutrient (or for energy), the difference between the amount supplied and the amount required is referred to as the balance. Nutritional models typically consider nutrients that are most relevant to the animal's functioning. This includes nutrients present in both large and small quantities: Macronutrients are required in large amounts, and typically present in large amounts in feeds. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are macronutrients. Micronutrients are required in comparatively smaller amounts, yet deficiencies (even of a few grams!) can be catastrophic to the animal's functioning. Micronutrients include vitamins and minerals. In this chapter, we will get very specific about what is meant by the term \"requirement.\" We will see some of the difficulties involved in formulating a diet that meets the needs of an entire group of animals, rather than a single animal. Additionally, we will discuss nutritional concepts and dietary reference intakes that help nutritionists protect against over- and underfeeding, each of which can have harmful effects. Is energy a nutrient? Energy is not a nutrient per se. Instead, energy is a physical property that refers to the capacity to do work. Energy is derived from macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fat). Animals require sufficient energy to maintain body functioning and performance, so energy supply and requirements are included in most nutritional models, including NASEM. 4.1.2 Requirement definitions in human and dairy nutrition Previous editions of “Nutrient Requirements for Dairy Cattle” did not explicitly define the term nutrient requirement, but NASEM includes an entire chapter delineating nutrient requirements and related terms. Much of this work is based on definitions used in human nutrition. NASEM's Food and Nutrition Board in the Institute of Medicine (Medicine (IOM) 2006) defined a series of terms outlining what nutrient requirement means in the human nutrition context. The dairy nutrition committee selected from these terms for use with dairy cattle. The NASEM book defines a nutrient requirement as “the daily amount of a nutrient necessary to meet a healthy animal’s needs for maintenance, activity, growth, reproduction, and lactation without any changes in body reserves or status” (NASEM, 2021, p. 4). Let's break down each part of this definition. the daily amount of a nutrient - In human and animal nutrition, nutrient requirements are often given in amounts per day. Thus, a requirement is a rate of amount consumed per unit time. The use of “day” as the denominator is practical. Per hour is too short a timescale, because animals do not require nutrients every hour to maintain their health and functioning. Yet per week is too long, because an animal deprived of a certain nutrient would probably show symptoms associated with that nutrient deficiency. Additionally, most cattle rations are mixed and fed once or twice daily, so farm operators need to know the amounts to feed once or twice daily. Therefore, amount per day is a logical choice of timescale for expressing the requirements of most nutrients. a healthy animal's needs - NASEM acknowledges that illnesses alter the physiological state of animals such that they have different nutrition requirements. However, each illness alters nutrient requirements differently. The committee decided that there was insufficient data to predict requirements for unhealthy animals presently. As such, requirements are based on the assumption that the animal is healthy. for maintenance, activity, growth, reproduction, and lactation without any changes in body reserves or status - This part explains that nutrient requirements are calculated to allow the animal to maintain various body functions without gaining or losing body reserves (e.g., losing fat or muscle mass) or status (e.g., losing milk production). Therefore, a nutrient requirement is specific to a given animal and scenario. Think to Yourself: How is the term nutrient requirement used colloquially, and how does this differ from its scientific definition? 4.1.3 Absorbed and metabolizable amounts Before moving on, we need to add more detail to what is meant by the daily amount of a nutrient. We know that not all the energy and nutrients eaten by an animal can be actually used for the body functions listed above. This is because a fraction of the energy and nutrients is excreted in feces and urine, and another fraction is lost as gas and heat. When discussing requirements, NASEM most often gives the amount of nutrient on a metabolizable basis. This means that when we define the daily amount of a nutrient required, we mean the amount that is actually available for the animal to use for body functions (metabolizable amount) rather than the total amount of intake (gross amount). This will be detailed in later chapters. Reporting requirements as metabolizable amounts applies to energy and most nutrients except minerals, which are considered on an absorbed basis. The committee most likely chose an absorbed basis for minerals due to data availability. Many mineral studies report the amount of circulating minerals in the blood (absorbed) and few studies analyze mineral content in excreta (feces and urine). Just for fun: Check a human food label. Similar to reporting for dairy cattle nutrition, human nutrition labels typically show the amounts of metabolizable energy and nutrients. 4.2 Dietary reference intakes We established a basic definition for a nutrient requirement. Estimating these average requirements is an important component of NASEM (2021). But NASEM Dairy-8 not only helps determine the daily amount of nutrient required on average (the mean), it also gives information about the variability around the average (the variance). As a consequence, the estimated average requirement is just one parameter in a class of terms referred to as dietary reference intakes. These dietary reference intakes combine information about both the mean and variance in a requirement to assist nutritionists in formulating rations that protect against under- and over-supplying nutrients. Dietary Reference Intakes include the estimated average requirement, the recommended daily allowance, adequate intake, and maximum tolerable level. Each of these will be defined in the subsequent sections. The dietary reference intakes are based on the principle that nutrient requirements are not a single fixed level of nutrient intake. Instead, nutrient requirements have both a mean and variance. In other words, a distribution. NASEM explains that within a given group of animals at a particular life stage, the distribution of responses to nutrient intake includes predictable and unpredictable variation. Predictable sources of variation are factors with a known effect on the animal's response to nutrient intake (e.g., stage of lactation, milk production, body weight). Conversely, unpredictable variation represents both random variation and unmeasured variation. 4.2.1 Protecting against underfeeding with \"safety factors\" Considering the variance in nutrient requirements is especially important when it comes to avoiding reductions in performance due to nutrient deficiencies. For example, let's imagine we have a population of lactating cows with a distribution of requirements that looks as shown below. We feed them the estimated average requirement (EAR), as shown with the vertical red line: Figure 4.2: Population distribution of nutrient requirements with reference intakes annotated. Test Yourself: What proportion of the population is being underfed if nutrient intake is at the EAR? When feeding the average requirement, we can see that about half the animals will be overfed, and half will be underfed the nutrient. Underfeeding nutrients is expected to worsen health and performance. For this reason, human and animal nutritionists often feed not the average requirement, but instead the average requirement plus a \"safety factor.\" In order to determine an appropriate safety factor, we need to know the variance in the requirement. For example, in human nutrition, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) refers to the EAR + two standard deviations (recall that standard deviation is a measure of variance). Figure 4.3: Population distribution of nutrient requirements with reference intakes annotated. Test Yourself: What proportion of the population is being underfed if nutrient intake is at the RDA (EAR + 2 standard deviations)? click here for an answer Because the RDA is set at 2 standard deviations above the EAR, when feeding at the RDA, only a small proportion (2-3%) of the population is being underfed. The majority (97-98%) of the population is being fed an adequate amount. This illustrates how nutritionists need to know both the mean and variance of a nutrient requirement to make informed decisions about the amount to feed. 4.2.2 Protecting against overfeeding For dairy cattle, it is often preferable to overfeed nutrients than to underfeed. However, there are risks associated with overfeeding that nutritionists must guard against. For example, overfeeding energy could result in excessive body reserve gain leading to an increased risk of ketosis. Overfeeding the mineral selenium can cause acute toxicosis. Overfeeding crude protein is associated with reduced reproductive performance and an increase in negative environmental impacts. In cases where toxicities have been observed and adequate data are available, NASEM provides the maximum tolerable level (MTL) of a nutrient. At the MTL, research has shown that symptoms of toxicity begin to occur. Vary in requirement. Keeping in mind that feeds vary in composition and animals vary in their requirements, nutritionists should aim to create rations that are sufficiently below the MTL to reduce the chances of toxicities. Test yourself The maximum tolerable level is the amount of nutrient that would kill an average animal. TRUEFALSE 4.2.3 Accounting for uncertainty Finally, NASEM acknowledged that there are certain cases where insufficient data are available to determine the mean and variance for a nutrient requirement. In these cases, the committee makes an educated guess on an appropriate level for the nutrient requirement. The best guess for the requirement is referred to not as an EAR, but instead as an adequate intake (AI). This distinction helps nutritionists determine whether the requirement has been determined after substantial experimental studies (EAR) or whether the requirement is an educated guess by the committee (AI). Putting it all together, we can see all of the dietary reference intakes discussed so far: Figure 4.4: Population distribution of nutrient requirements with reference intakes annotated. Think to Yourself: The figure shows several reference intake levels. What does each mean, and when might it be useful? 4.3 NASEM estimates of requirements To estimate nutrient requirements, NASEM calculates separate requirements for each different body functions: including requirements for maintenance, activity, growth, reproduction, lactation, and changes in body reserves. Summing these requirements gives the total requirement for each nutrition. This method for calculating requirements is referred to as a factorial approach because it sums the contributions of different factors to determine the total requirement. As an example, the net protein recommended for an animal equals the sum of its separate net protein requirements for maintenance, activity, growth, reproduction, and changes in body reserves. \\[ NP_{total} = NP_{maintenance} + NP_{activity} + NP_{growth}+ NP_{reproduction} + NP_{bodyreserve} \\] Test yourself The factorial approach refers to summing across multiple factors. TRUEFALSE 4.4 Types of literature used by NASEM (2021) We know now that a nutrient requirement is the daily (metabolizable or absorbed) amount of a nutrient required to support an animal's body functioning without changing body reserves and status. We also know that requirements are often calculated factorially, e.g., separate requirements are estimated for maintenance, gestation, lactation, growth, and reserve gain and summed together to estimate the total nutrient requirement. Yet how does NASEM (2021) determine the required nutrient needed for separate body functions? The committee uses a variety of types of research. The narrative in NASEM (2021) focuses on research done after the 7th edition (NRC, 2001), but it also cites some classical studies done in prior years. Some examples of the types of literature referenced by NASEM are discussed below. 4.4.1 Measuring composition of inputs, body tissues, and outputs **** citation ** Nutrient requirements for growth and changes in body reserves are often estimated using data on body composition. For example, early researchers determined the chemical composition of the carcasses of animals slaughtered at different ages. They assumed that 1 kg of growth in the body frame (carcass) would require at least as many nutrients as were contained in 1 kg of the body frame at slaughter. Similarly, studies have measured the composition of cows with more or less body reserve (body reserves = primarily adipose and muscle tissue). This type of research is often used to calculate nutrient requirements expected for certain rates (kg/d) of growth and changes in body reserves. Researchers in the mid-20th century studied the chemical composition of the gravid (pregnant) uterus, including the fetus, placenta, and the uterus itself. They tracked the growth of the gravid uterus across the gestation period. This type of research helped determined nutrient requirements for gestation, often based on the gestational age (days pregnant) and the expected weight of the calf. 4.4.2 Measuring losses when intake is minimal (Swanson1977?) To determine maintenance requirements, one experimental approach involves feeding animals very little of the nutrient in question for a short period. Then, researchers can determine the amount of nutrient that would be lost (in urine and feces) through body functions alone (not diet). For example, part of the maintenance requirement for protein is the amount of protein lost in feces due to typical gastrointestinal tract secretions and sloughed cells. This fraction is referred to as metabolic fecal protein. Typically, the protein in feces includes both metabolic fecal protein and undigested dietary protein. When minimal protein is fed, the amount of undigested dietary protein approaches zero. This isolates the amount of metabolic protein needed by the animal. A similar approach is used to determine the energy, protein, and minerals lost in urine as part of maintenance body functions. 4.4.3 Studying symptoms of deficiency and toxicity ** citation ** The NASEM (2021) committee also used studies that reported observable symptoms of deficiency and toxicity. For example, vitamin D deficiency (rickets) is known to cause a stiff gait, bowed legs, and increased incidence of fractures. By studying the levels of absorbed vitamin D that were associated with visible symptoms, the committee could establish minimum nutrient requirements. Conversely, the committee set upper limits by examining the level of nutrient associated with symptoms of toxicity. This approach was particularly important with vitamin and mineral requirements. 4.4.4 Regression on productive performance ** citation ** Finally, the NASEM (2021) committee cited several works where requirements was studied with a regression approach. When data are abundant, regression enables researchers to mathematically relate values of a nutrient (X) to an animal performance trait (Y). For example, milk and milk component data are often used as dependent (Y) variables in regression. This is because nearly every study with dairy cattle measures the production of milk and components. For many people, regression calls to mind the image of a line. Perhaps in high school, they learned that a line can describe the relationship between X and Y variables by an intercept and slope. The regressions cited by NASEM (2021) uses a similar idea. However, the relationship between the metabolizable amount of a nutrient (X) and animal performance (Y) is generally not expected to be a single line. Two common shapes are given below. 4.4.4.1 Breakpoint analysis or \"broken-stick\" response (Robbins2006?) Assuming the same animal and diet characteristics, one way researchers have conceptualized requirements is through breakpoint analysis. With this framework in mind, researchers examine the performance response (e.g., the production of fat- and protein-corrected milk, FPCM) with increasing metabolizable amounts of nutrient X. The requirement is expected to be the \"breakpoint\" where additional amounts of nutrient (X) lead to zero gains in performance (Y). Breakpoint analysis is sometimes referred to as a \"broken-stick\" model, because it resemble a stick of wood that has been snapped. More technically, it is a piecewise linear function. The breakpoint or broken-stick model supposes the following: Feeding more nutrient X will increase FPCM production if nutrient X is deficient. Feeding above the requirement for nutrient X will result in no gains in FPCM (response = 0). Figure 4.5: Broken-stick response to nutrient X metaboliazble amounts 4.4.4.2 Curvlinear response (Pesti2009?) Sometimes, the broken-stick type response does not match well with the observed data. This can be because excessive amounts of the nutrient X lead to declines in performance Y, rather than Y remaining flat. Or perhaps the relation between X and Y may appear to be made up of curves rather than lines. In these cases, we can express the relation of X and Y using mathematical terms for curves. For example, polynomial functions, e.g., \\(FPCM = 25 + 12x -0.1x^2\\) can describe a gradual increase in performance that curves to reach a maximum and declines. A logistic function can describe a situation where additional metabolizable amounts of nutrient X result in smaller and smaller gains in performance (Y). Various mathematical functions are used \"behind the scenes\" in the NASEM Dairy-8 (2021) nutritional model, and they are based on regression work. In general, nutrient requirements are determined by experiments where different levels of a nutrient are fed and animals' responses (e.g., bodyweight, milk production, reproductive performance) are observed. Let's consider a hypothetical nutrient X. A single experiment might compare just a few levels of nutrient X and record the average response. For example, researchers could feed 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5% of diet dry matter as calcium and record the response with each level. Over time, more experiments are done. The data from multiple experiments can be combined through meta-analysis. Compared to an experiment that shows responses to just a few levels of nutrient X metabolizable amounts, a meta-analysis can show animal responses across a large range of nutrient X metabolizable amounts. Using data from the meta-analysis, researchers can plot animal performance at each level of nutrient X intake to determine the nutrient requirement for a given scenario. Test Yourself: Assume you have the data to plot the volume of milk production (Y) at different levels of the metabolizable amount of nutrient X. How would you determine the required amount of nutrient X for each level of milk production?

Source: http://blog.modernmechanix.com Learning Objectives List some of the \"machinery\" (mathematical operations) used in nutritional models. Discuss model descriptors such as empirical and mechanistic. Discuss limitations of nutritional models. In the last chapter, we learned about some of the core parameters in the NASEM model: supplies and requirements. In this chapter, we will roll up our sleeves and look under the hood of the NASEM model to learn more about other types of parameters beyond supplies and requirements. We will also discuss some of the core mathematical concepts that underlie the NASEM model functioning. The chapter is titled \"Model machinery\" because it discusses some of the fundamental math that makes the NASEM model work. Nutrition involves primarily practical mathematical and statistical problems. Animal nutritionists use nutritional modeling software to do the \"heavy lifting\" for many types of calculations. We will consider three categories of math and statistics that are used often by nutritionists, as these also form the basis of many nutritional models. Basic mathematics Predictive models Optimization 5.1 Basic nutrition math Under the hood, some parts of the NASEM model are basic operations such as converting units, converting the basis, and scaling quantities. These operations are based on general facts, so they are unlikely to change with future updates to the model. For example, 1 kg will always equal 1000 g. 5.1.1 Using ratios, percentages, proportions Some of the most frequent math problems done by nutritional scientists are quite simple. To get started, we just need to review some elementary math. The definitions may seem quite simple, but they can lead to huge errors if done incorrectly! Relating any two quantities: Ratios relate any two quantities with different units, or the same units. Ratios can be expressed as a fraction or as a numeral. In either case, the ratio must be expressed with units. Relating parts of a whole: Percentages are often used to relate two quantities with the same units and expressed as a number between 0 and 100. Proportions convey the same information as a percentage, except they are expressed as a fraction of 1. Percentages and proportions can sometimes get confusing if there are no units. This is why it can be helpful to explicitly state the units rather than using the % sign. For example, the fat content of milk (e.g., 3.7%) could be expressed equivalently as the kg of fat per 100 kg of milk (\\(\\frac{3.7 \\space kg \\space fat}{100 \\space kg \\space milk}\\)). The word \"percent\" literally translates to \"per 100\"! As a proportion, we could write \\(\\frac{0.037 \\text{ kg milk fat }}{\\text{1 kg milk}}\\). Next time you hear a percent or proportion, ask yourself... 1) what are the numerator and denominator? 2) What are the units? Test Yourself: True or false: ratios can be expressed without units. TRUEFALSE How are percentages expressed? As a fractionAs a dividendAs a number between 0 and 100 True or false: ratios can be used to relate quantities with the same units? TRUEFALSE 5.1.2 Converting units In the field, many animal producers in the U.S. use units based on both the Imperial system (e.g., lbs, inches) and the metric system (e.g., grams, meters). However, most research in animal nutrition is published using the metric system. The metric system is somewhat simpler, in that the prefixes of a unit represents its order of magnitude relative to the base unit (e.g., a gram). Most quantities that apply for single animal nutritional models range from the milligram to kilogram range. Nutritionists work with a variety of input data, and they often need to convert units from smaller amounts (e.g., the animal level) to larger amounts (e.g., the farm level). Order of Magnitude Prefix Unit Value pico p 10^-12 nano n 10^-9 micro µ 10^-6 milli m 10^-3 centi c 10^-2 deci d 10^-1 deca da 10^1 hecto h 10^2 kilo k 10^3 mega M 10^6 giga G 10^9 Test yourself: Metric practice What is the mass in kg of 50 lbs feed? Use one decimals. kg A bull has a mass of 900 kg. How many pounds does the bull weigh? Report the whole number with no decimals. lbs. If a vet prescribes 1.5 g of a medication, and each tablet contains 125 mg, how many tablets should be given? tablets Show explanations 50 lbs * (1 kg/ 2.2 lb) = 22.68 kg 900 * 2.2 = 1980 1,500 mg * (1 tablet / 125 mg) = 12 tablets 5.1.3 Converting basis In animal nutrition, almost everything from feed to animal tissues contains water. The water content can vary substantially. Although water is important in nutrition, nutritionists generally do calculations on a dry matter basis. This means that quantities are expressed as a fraction of the non-water (dry matter) content, rather than as a fraction of the total. Feed as-is and dry matter contents, illustrating how a fraction C can be thought of on a different basis. For a nutrient called C, the proportion of C on an as-is basis is calculated as the mass of C divided by the total mass including wet and dry matter. \\[ \\text{As-is basis }= \\frac{\\text{mass of C}}{\\text{total mass of water and dry matter}} \\] To calculate the proportion of C on a DM basis, we divide the mass of C by the mass of DM, ignoring the wet matter. \\[ \\text{DM basis }= \\frac{\\text{mass of C}}{\\text{ mass of dry matter }} \\] Most of the NASEM predictions are done on a dry matter basis. This means that quantities are expressed in relation to the dry matter content of a feed (as fractions of the dry matter content). For some feeds, it makes an enormous difference whether nutrient composition is expressed on a DM basis vs. as-is basis (e.g., corn silage, grass silage). For other feeds, it makes no difference at all (e.g., limestone, iron oxide) because the feed contains very minimal water. To convert nutrient content from an as-is basis to a DM basis, we need to know: The DM content of the feed The nutrient content of the feed It can help to write down everything you know, including units. \\[15 \\text{ %CP, as-is basis} = \\frac{\\text{15 kg feed CP}}{\\text{100 kg feed as-is}} \\\\[16pt] 50\\text{% DM as-is basis} = \\frac{50 \\text{ kg feed DM}}{100\\text{ kg feed DM}}\\] To convert to a DM basis, we need to think about our desired units: kg CP / kg DM. Thinking backwards, we can use the other information we have (the DM content of the feed). Ratios are useful, because we can invert them (flip them) whichever way we need, as long as we keep track of the units. \\[\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\text{15 kg feed CP}}{\\text{100 kg feed as-is}} * \\frac{\\text{100 kg feed as-is}}{\\text{50 kg feed DM}} &amp;=\\\\[6pt] \\frac{15 \\text{ kg feed CP}}{50 \\text{kg feed DM}}&amp; = \\\\[6pt] \\frac{30 \\text{ kg feed CP}}{100 \\text{ kg feed DM}} &amp;= 30 \\text{% CP on a DM basis} \\end{aligned}\\] To go in the reverse direction, we can convert back to an as-is basis. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\text{30 kg feed CP}}{\\text{100 kg feed DM}} * \\frac{\\text{50 kg feed DM}}{\\text{100 kg feed as-is}} &amp;=\\\\[6pt] \\frac{30 * 50 \\text{ kg feed CP}}{100*100 \\text{ kg feed as-is} } &amp;= \\\\[6pt] \\frac{0.15 \\text{ kg feed CP}} {1 \\text{ kg feed as-is}} = \\frac{15 \\text{ kg feed CP}} {100 \\text{ kg feed as-is}} &amp;= 15 \\text{ % CP as-is}\\\\[6pt] \\end{aligned} \\] Here's the kicker - the dry matter basis is not the only basis used in nutrition. Sometimes nutrient content is expressed in relation to other quantities. For example, in field work, nutritionists sometimes refer to the rumen-degradable and rumen-undegradable fractions of crude protein. Therefore, these fractions are not expressed per 100 units of feed dry matter, they are expressed per 100 units of feed CP. Nutrient digestibility is typically given as a percentage of that particular nutrient intake (e.g., fiber digestibility as a percentage of fiber intake). Therefore, it is critical to keep track of the units in the numerator and denominator when doing any sort of nutrition calculations to prevent errors. Test yourself Assuming the feed contains water, the amount of a nutrient on a DM basis is less thangreater than the amount on an as-is basis. Test yourself A nutritionist is given the crude protein (CP) content of a feed on an as-is basis. CP% as-is = 8% Because most nutritional calculations are done on a DM basis, they want to convert this value to a DM basis. What other information do they need? amount of feed in rationdry matter content of the feedweight of the feed Try to do the conversion of the as-is to DM basis yourself, assuming the DM content of the feed is 35%. click here for the answer CP % as-is = 8% DM content of the feed = 35% (8% ) * (100 / 35) = 22.8% CP on a DM basis Additional literature For some extra practice and visualizations of DM and as-is basis calculations, check out this resource by Reiling (2022) and the University of Nebraska Extension: https://extensionpublications.unl.edu/assets/html/g2093/build/g2093.htm 5.1.4 Scaling Scaling involves multiplying every element of a vector or matrix by the same, single number. Incidentally, this is why one single number is sometimes referred to as a \"scalar.\" Often, operations in the NASEM model simply involve scaling chemical composition (e.g., the percentages of each chemical in a feed or body pool) to amounts. For example, we can scale the diet composition by the DMI to determine the amount of intake of each nutrient. \\[{kg \\space DMI \\space* \\begin{bmatrix} \\text{% ADF in diet}\\\\ \\text{% NDF in diet} \\\\ \\text{% CP in diet} \\\\ \\text{% Fat in diet} \\\\ \\text{% Ash in diet} \\end{bmatrix} /100 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\text{kg ADF intake}\\\\ \\text{kg NDF intake} \\\\ \\text{kg CP intake} \\\\ \\text{kg Fat intake} \\\\ \\text{kg Ash intake} \\end{bmatrix}}\\] Scaling milk composition to amounts Producers typically have information about the fat, protein, and lactose composition of milk (%) and the mass of milk produced (kg or lb). By scaling the composition using the total amount, we can calculate the amounts of fat, protein, and lactose production. Given the following information: Fat = 3.85% True protein = 3.10% Lactose = 4.65% Milk production = 36 kg Calculate the amounts of fat, true protein, and lactose produced. Click here for an answer The problem can be set up as follows: $${ kg Milk production \\[\\begin{bmatrix} \\text{% Fat in milk} \\\\ \\text{% True protein in milk}\\\\ \\text{% Lactose in milk} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\] /100 = \\[\\begin{bmatrix} \\text{kg Fat production} \\\\ \\text{kg True protein production}\\\\ \\text{kg Lactose production} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\] }$$ Using this formula, we would calculate as follows: 36 * 3.85 / 100 = 1.386 kg fat 36 * 3.10 / 100 = 1.116 kg true protein 36 * 4.65 / 100 = 1.674 kg lactose 5.1.5 Weighting Weighting involves multiplying each element of a set of values with its corresponding element in a set of weights. Weighted sums and weighted means are common in animal nutrition. For example, weighted means are used to calculate diet composition from ingredient composition and ingredient inclusion rates. A weighted sum is the sum of the products of a set of values (\\(x\\)) and weights (\\(w\\)). \\[ \\text{Weighted sum}= \\sum_{i = 1}^{n \\space feeds} w_ix_i \\] \\(x_i\\) is the value to be weighted (e.g., nutrient composition of feed \\(i\\)) \\(w_i\\) is the weight (e.g., the inclusion rate of feed \\(i\\)) To calculate a weighted mean, we divide the weighted sum (the numerator) by the sum of the weights. \\[ \\text{Weighted mean}= \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} w_ix_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i} \\] where \\(x_i\\) is the \\(i\\)th value, and \\(w_i\\) is the weight corresponding to \\(x_i\\). If the weights are expressed as proportions (out of 1), the weighted mean and weighted sum are equivalent because the denominator is 1. If the weights are expressed as percentages (out of 100), or some other way, the denominator is more important. As an example, for a given diet, we could multiply the fat content of each feed by the inclusion rate of each feed (as a proportion). Then, we would sum up all of the values to get the fat content of the diet. Calculating diet fat content with a weighted mean A diet includes 45% corn silage, 20% alfalfa silage and 35% concentrate mix (inclusion rates). The fat content of these feeds are: Corn silage, fat = 2.5% of DM Alfalfa silage, fat = 2.0% of DM Concentrate mix, fat = 9.0% of DM. What is the fat content of the diet? click here for a worked example Calculate each (\\(w_i x_i\\)) for the n = 3 feeds. 0.45 * 2.5 = 1.125 0.20 * 2.0 = 0.40 0.35 * 9.0 = 3.15 Sum the \\(w_i x_i\\) for the n = 3 feeds. 1.125 + 0.40 + 3.15 = 4.675 5.2 Predictive models Another set of mathematical operations in nutrition stems from predictive models. Predictive models are equations that stem from statistical analysis of nutritional data through techniques such as regression. Each equation embodies the relationships among dependent (Y) and independent (X) variables. Using a predictive model is simple...plug known values (Xs) into the equation to solve for the unknown (Y) variable. When new data become available, nutritionists will often want to update the predictive models. As a result, the sections of nutritional models that have been developed through statistical analysis are continually changing. As an example, we previously used a predictive model: \\(DMI \\space (kg) = 0.03 * BW\\). To use it, we plugged in known values to the right-hand side (independent variables). \\(DMI\\) = ? \\(0.03\\) a coefficient relating DMI and BW determined in past research \\(BW\\) = 702 \\(DMI = 0.03*702\\) \\(DMI = 21.06 kg\\) Of course, some of the actual models in NASEM are a bit more complex. For example, an actual equation for predicting DMI in NASEM (p. 12, eq. 2-1) uses parity, BW, body condition score (BCS), day in lactation, and milk net energy production. Researchers observed 3,143 lactations where roughly half the observations represented primiparous cows and half were from multiparous cows. After testing different equations, they found one that provided a good fit with the data: \\[\\begin{aligned} DMI (kg/d) &amp;= [3.7 + (5.7*Parity) + \\\\ &amp;\\quad (0.305*MilkE) + \\\\ &amp;\\quad (0.022*BW) + \\\\ &amp;\\quad (-0.689-1.87*Parity)*BCS]*\\\\ &amp;\\quad [1-(0.212+0.136*Parity)*e^{(-0.053*DIM)}] \\end{aligned}\\] Oh my! It's much more complex than our simple example. In this equation, we have a few more terms: \\(Parity\\) is the proportion of cows that are multiparous (ranges from 0 to 1) \\(BCS\\) is the body condition score from 1 (thin) to 5 (obese) \\(BW\\) is the bodyweight in kg \\(MilkE\\) is the energy produced in milk, in Mcal/d \\(DIM\\) is the day in milk, an integer number of days since the start of lactation Test yourself Which term is the intercept in this equation? BW13.7 On the one hand, we can use this equation without knowing how it works...we just plug in values for the known variables and get our estimate of DMI. Woohoo! But to be responsible animal nutritionists, we should probably dig a bit deeper into the relationships implied by the equation. The intercept tells us the expected value of the dependent variable (Y) when all of the independent variables (Xs) are set to zero. In this case, the intercept suggests that there is a small amount of DMI (3.7 kg) predicted even if all other variables are entered as zeroes. Each regression coefficient describes the magnitude and direction of a relationship between an independent variable and the dependent variable. In this equation, there are several terms with positive coefficients (Parity, MilkE, BW). These suggest that a greater proportion of multiparous cows, greater milk energy production, andg greater bodyweight are predictive of greater DMI (positive relationship). The last part of the equation includes some complex terms where there are interactions. In an interaction, two variables (e.g., milk production and BW) are multiplied with each other rather than added. Additionally, Euler's constant \\(e\\) appears in the expression \\(e^{(-0.053*DIM)}\\). This part is an adjustment for depressed intake in early lactation. 5.2.1 Prediction using software Although this math can be done on paper or with a calculator, if you are so inclined, you can try this in your favorite computer program. The program makes it easier to plug in values and generate an estimate. NASEM dairy-8 Example 5.2.1.1 NASEM dairy-8 Open the dairy-8 program.

How would its growth rate (mass/time) change as it got larger? The rate:state equation tells us the growth rate. The growth rate is expressed here as the difference in mass (\\(dM\\)) per the difference in time (\\(dt\\)). This is referred to as first order kinetics, because the mass (\\(M\\)) is multiplied by a scalar \\(a^1 = a\\). \\[ \\frac{dM}{dt} = a M \\] where \\(a\\) is the growth constant. This equation suggests that as the mass grows, the \"growth machinery\" also grows. In other words, an animal that weighs 50 lbs might grow 0.5 lbs per day, but an animal at 500 lbs would grow at a faster rate (5 lbs per day) proportional to its mass. Integrating the rate:state equation (finding the area underneath it) allows us to find the mass at any point in time. We find the definite integral from the start of the process \\(t = 0\\) to another point in time \\(t = t_1\\). The integral tells us that the mass at a given time \\(M\\) is equal to the initial mass \\(M_0\\) times the exponential of \\(at\\), the growth constant multiplied by time. \\[ M = M_0e^{at} \\] Functions similar to this integrated rate law appear in the NASEM model to predict the growth rate of the fetus during gestation. Importantly, the function is cut off after the time of calving (otherwise, the mass would continue to increase!). Test yourself First order kinetics means that the mass grows at a constant rate. TRUEFALSE The exponential function (integrated rate equation) shown above would slow down after enough time had passed. TRUEFALSE Literature deep dive France et al. (1996) described growth rates in animal science. France, J., Dijkstra, J., &amp; Dhanoa, M. S. (1996). Growth functions and their application in animal science. In Annales de zootechnie (Vol. 45, No. Suppl1, pp. 165-174). 5.2.3 Saturable growth kinetics The Michaelis-Menten model describes a saturable growth process. A function is saturable when it reaches an upper or lower bound rather than continuing infinitely. This form of growth is used in NASEM to model microbial protein synthesis. The Michaelis-Menten equation uses the term velocity, which is a general term encompassing the changes in products \\(\\frac{d[P]}{dt}\\) and substrates \\(\\frac{d[S]}{dt}\\) over time. \\[v = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}\\] where \\(V\\) is the growth rate \\(S\\) is the substrate concentration \\(V_{max}\\) is the maximum velocity (max. reaction rate) and \\(V_{max}/2\\) is half the maximum velocity. The velocity is \\(V_{max}/2\\) when \\(K_m = [S]\\). \\(K_m\\) is the Michaelis constant, which is the concentration of substrate when the reaction velocity is 50% of the \\(V_{max}\\) At low concentrations the velocity is proportional to the concentration of substrate \\(S\\). One way to think of this is that \\(K_m\\) is larger than \\([S]\\), so \\(K_m + [S] \\approx K_m\\), so the velocity is affected by the ratio of \\(\\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\) times the maximum velocity. This is similar to first-order kinetics, where the growth rate (velocity) is a linear function of the growth machinery (e.g., the substrate concentration). At this point, the growth is not saturated. At high concentrations of substrate \\(S\\), the rate approaches a maximum velocity. This is because \\([S]\\) has become larger than \\(K_m\\), and \\(K_m + [S] \\approx [S]\\). The rate is \\(\\frac{[S]}{[S]}\\) times the maximum velocity ($ * V_{max}$. This is more similar to zeroth-order kinetics, because the growth rate is constant. The growth process becomes saturated as it gets closer and closer to \\(V_{max}\\). Feeling confused? Click below for a more practical example. 🍞 Tell me an analogy on saturable growth Imagine you owned a bakery of a certain size with 13 dedicated bakers (a baker's dozen! 👨‍🍳). You are in charge of providing the bakers ingredients (substrates). At first you give them no ingredients. The bakers make no bread, and sit around the bakery all day. Then, you decide to start giving them a small amount of ingredients every day. They are very excited and make as much bread as they can using the ingredients. At the end of the day, they still have some time to relax. The bakers send you a note - \"We would be happy to make more bread if you give us more ingredients.\" You increase the amount of ingredients provided per day. The bakers are still very excited, and they make even more bread than ever before. They have less time to relax. At this stage, you start to think that the amount of bread made is proportional to the amount of ingredients provided. This is great news, you think, because if you simply provide more ingredients to the bakers, everyone will get more bread. You tell the bakers - it's time to push it to the limit. You offer them thousands of pounds of ingredients to use as fast as they can. The bakers spend all day making as much bread as they can, but at the end of the day there are still ingredients leftover. They can't seem to catch up! You keep giving them more ingredients, expecting more bread. The bakers work as fast as they can. In desperation, the bakers finally send you an angry note - \"There is a limit to how fast we can make bread!!!\" 5.2.4 Allometric equations An animal's nutritional processes are clearly affected by its body weight (BW). Yet the relationship is not necessarily linear. Instead, nutritionists use allometric equations to estimate how body processes (e.g., basal metabolic rate) will scale to animals with different body weights. Allometric equations are those that relate body weight to physiological and anatomical features. They have the general form \\(y = a * BW^b\\), where \\(a\\) is the intercept when \\(BW\\) = 1, \\(BW\\) is the body weight, and \\(b\\) is the scaling parameter. There are two major theories explaining allometric scaling: In 1883, Rubner proposed that surface area was an important determinant of metabolic rate. Smaller animals have a greater surface area to volume ratio than larger animals, and therefore require a faster metabolic rate. Heat is dissipated through the surface. This led to a scaling of metabolic rate of \\(BW^{0.67}\\). In the 1930s, Kleiber originally empirically derived the \\(BW^{0.75}\\) scaling relationship across mammals. West and Brown (2005) proposed that the fluid dynamics of blood within the fractal branching of the circulatory system determine the metabolic rate. This leads to metabolic scaling of \\(BW^{0.75}\\) in most animals. In very small animals, they proposed that blood viscosity increasingly determines blood flow, leading to a scaling of metabolic rate closer to \\(BW^{0.67}\\). Figure 5.2: Surface area and volume for cubes with increasing side length The idea of surface area and volume scaling differently might make more sense if we consider a cube of increasing size. \\(Surface \\space Area \\space (A) = 6s^2\\) \\(Volume \\space (V) = s^3\\) Side Length (s) Surface Area (A) Volume (V) 1 6 1 2 24 8 3 54 27 4 96 64 5 150 125 6 216 216 7 294 343 8 384 512 9 486 729 10 600 1000 Figure 5.3: Allometric scaling example for cattle West and Brown's (2005) BW^0.75 concept is somewhat harder to visualize. Still, we can picture somewhat how it works by imagining the fractal branching of the circulatory system. Figure 5.4: A fractal tree illustrating branching similar to circulation in the animal.

Optimization involves writing an objective function describing the goal (e.g., the lowest cost ration, the most environmentally-favorable ration), listing out a set of constraints (e.g., nutrient requirements, available feeds), and using an optimization technique (e.g., linear optimization) to find the best possible solution(s). As an example, we could write an objective function that minimizes the total cost of a ration containing \\(n\\) feeds, where each feed \\(i\\) has its own cost \\(c_i\\) and a certain inclusion rate \\(x_i\\) in the diet. The \"objective\" function is a mathematical way of stating our ultimate goal (our objective). \\[ \\begin{equation*} \\text{minimize } \\sum_{i=1}^{n_i} c_i x_i \\end{equation*} \\] In other words if we have several feeds numbered 1 to \\(n\\), we want to minimize the sum of the total diet cost. The total diet cost is calculated by weighting the feed ingredient costs (\\(c_i\\)) by the feed ingredient inclusion rate \\(x_i\\). \\[= \\text{minimize } c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + ... + c_nx_n \\] Next, we can write some constraints that express mathematically what we consider feasible diets. For example, we may want the nutrient composition to fall within a certain range. On a DM basis, we know that: Feed 1 is 10% protein and 40% NDF. Feed 2 is 30% protein and 10% NDF. Feed 3 is 50% protein and 30% NDF. Weighting by the inclusion rates, we can write an equation for the protein and NDF concentration in the diet: Diet protein concentration (% of DM) = \\(10x_1 + 30x_2 + 50x_3\\) Diet NDF concentration (% of DM) = $40x_1 + 10x_2 + 30x_3 $ Then we can set these equations to be greater or less than certain numbers to constrain the diet composition. We want our inclusion rates to add up to 1 so we have the proportion of each feed entering the diet. Clearly, we cannot have negative inclusion rates for any feeds, so we need to add constraints to make sure all inclusion rates are greater than or equal to zero. To summarize the constraints: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{Protein concentration} \\quad &amp; 10x_1 + 30x_2 + 50x_3 \\geq 15 \\\\ \\text{NDF concentration} \\quad &amp; 40x_1 + 10x_2 + 30x_3 \\geq 25 \\\\ \\text{NDF concentration} \\quad &amp; 40x_1 + 10x_2 + 30x_3 \\leq 35 \\\\ \\text{Ingredient proportions sum} \\quad &amp; x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1 \\\\ \\text{amount of ingredients cannot be negative} \\quad &amp; \\begin{cases} x_1 \\geq 0 \\\\ x_2 \\geq 0 \\\\ x_3 \\geq 0 \\end{cases} \\end{align*} \\] Feasible region for optimization example. Only certain combinations of x1, x2, and x3 are feasible given our constraints. In three dimensions, our constraint equations form a polygonol plane - the feasible region. Unfeasible combinations that do not meet the constraints we specified fall outside of the blue shape. If we had more than three ingredients, we would have more than three dimensions, which becomes difficult to imagine. The constraints would form a polyhedron in n-dimensional space. Set up as amounts per 100 kg of feed (in nutrient matrix and others) also get costs per 100 kg feed. Finally, to optimize, we need to know our feed costs (USD / kg feed DM). As usual, it is very important to keep track of the units and the basis (dry matter or as-is). Feed 1 = $0.15 Feed 2 = $0.20 Feed 3 = $0.50 Literature deep dive Optimization is used widely in finance, engineering, economics, and other fields. Yet some of the first recorded uses of linear optimization are for nutrition. For example, during World War II, the mathematician George Dantzig took a leave from his doctoral program to serve as an analyst for the U.S. Air Force. Tasked with finding affordable and nutritionally-adequate meals, Dantzig used his mathematics training to design an algorithm that is still widely-used today. As summarized by Van Dooren (2018): Dantzig tested his model on his own diet, constructing a database with 50 foods. He wanted to reduce his caloric intake to 1,500 kcal and programmed an objective function to maximize the feeling of being full (operationalized as the weight per unit minus the weight of its water content). The solution he found was a weird diet with 200 bouillon cubes per day. This was possible because the former nutritional requirements didn't show a limit to the amount of salt. These results led to upper bounds being added to LP for the first time. This illustrates the complexity of setting up optimization problems, and the necessity for double-checking that the results are applicable to the real world! Van Dooren, C. (2018).

The abomasum is located after the forestomachs (rumen, reticulum and omasum) and before the first segment of the small intestine (i.e., the duodenum); It is sometimes referred to as the \"true\" stomach because of its acid-secreting ability, which is found in most other mammalian species. Precision 1. The degree with which a measurement is reproducible, that is, yielding similar results when repeated (see also Accuracy). 2. the number of significant digits to which a value has been reliably measured.

The abomasum is located after the forestomachs (rumen, reticulum and omasum) and before the first segment of the small intestine (i.e., the duodenum); It is sometimes referred to as the \"true\" stomach because of its acid-secreting ability, which is found in most other mammalian species. Allometric (Equation) Allometric equations take the general form Y = aMb, where Y is some biological variable, M is a measure of body size, and b is some scaling exponent. See West et al.

Abomasum The fourth digestive chamber of the digestive system of most ruminants. The abomasum is located after the forestomachs (rumen, reticulum and omasum) and before the first segment of the small intestine (i.e., the duodenum); It is sometimes referred to as the \"true\" stomach because of its acid-secreting ability, which is found in most other mammalian species. As-Is Basis A method of expressing the concentration of a nutrient in a feed. For example, a feed containing 12% crude protein on a dry matter basis contains 12 g of protein for each 100 g of feed \"as-is\" (or \"fresh\"). When feed ingredients are added to a mixer, they are weighted on an \"as-is\" of \"fresh\" basis. See also \"Dry Matter Basis. NA The fourth digestive chamber of the digestive system of most ruminants. The abomasum is located after the forestomachs (rumen, reticulum and omasum) and before the first segment of the small intestine (i.e., the duodenum); It is sometimes referred to as the \"true\" stomach because of its acid-secreting ability, which is found in most other mammalian species. Bezoar A small stony concretion that may form in the stomachs of certain animals, especially ruminants. Bezoars are caused by a buildup of material in the gastrointestinal tract that the stomach can't digest. Bloat A swelling of the left side of the cow caused by a frothy material which prevents gases of fermentation from being eructed from the rumen. Occurs primarily when cows are grazing certain species of legumes especially, alfalfa. If not treated immediately, bloat can cause death in a matter of hours. More... Buffer A chemical substances, such as sodium bicarbonate, that can maintain the pH of the rumen content around neutrality (pH = 6 to 7). The pH is maintained by neutralizing the volatile fatty acids and other organic acids produced by ruminal fermentation. Bull (Clean-Up) A bull used for natural mating after mutiple artificial insemination attempts have failed to establish pregnancy. Calorie A unit of heat that can be used to measure the amount of energy in a feed or a ration. A calorie is the amount heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water from 14.5 ° centigrade to 15.5 ° centigrade. Calve (To) (see Parturition) Carbohydrate Any of a group of chemical compounds, including sugars, starches, and cellulose, containing only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with a ratio of hydrogen to oxygen of 2:1. Carbon Dioxide (Co2) A gas produced by combustion or oxidation of organic matter. Carbon dioxide is also produced in large quantities during ruminal fermentation. Catabolism The part of the metabolism in which metabolites are oxidized for the production of work and heat. Catalyst A substance present in small amounts that increases the rate of chemical or biochemical reactions without being consumed in the process. Cell Wall Fibrous structure that provides rigidity to the plant. The cell wall is composed of digestible fibrous carbohydrates (cellulose; hemicellulose and pectin) and an indigestible phenolic compounds (e.g., lignin and tannin). Cellulose (C6h10o5)N: A polymer - long chain- of glucose units. Cellulose is the most abundant organic matter in the world. It is a major component of plant cell wall. Ruminant can use cellulose as an energy source because of fermentation by bacteria in the rumen. Cereal A plant in the grass family (gramineae), the seeds (i.e., grain) of which are used for human and animal food (e.g., maize, rice and wheat). Chaff Glumes, husk, or other seed coverings, together with the plant parts, separated from seeds in threshing or processing. Chew (To) To crush or grind (food) in the mouth by continued action of the teeth with the help of the tongue (syn to masticate). Clinical Involving or based on direct observation of the patient (a clinical diagnosis). A clinical disease is a disease that can be diagnosed by examination because of signs / symptoms of discomfort, anomalies of the normal state Cob The central core of an ear of corn. Colostrum The thick and yellowish secretion collected from the mammary gland at the first milking after calving. The colostrum is low in lactose but normally high in total solid (24%). It is rich in fat, proteins and antibodies that help the new born calf to fight infectious diseases. The secretion collected from the second to the eighth milking is referred to as \"transition milk\" because of it intermediate composition between colostrum and whole milk. Concentrate Feedstuffs usually rich in energy and coming from the part of the plant that accumulate nutrient reserves for an embryo (fruits, nuts, seeds and grains). The word concentrate is also used to refer to the mixture of minerals and other supplements used to feed dairy cattle. Crown Base of the stem where roots arise Crude Protein A measure of the amount of protein in a feed determined as the amount of nitrogen multiplied by 6.25. The factor 6.25 is the average grams of protein that contains 1 gram of nitrogen. The word \"crude\" refers to the fact that not all nitrogen in most feed is exclusively in the form of protein. Because most feeds contain non-protein nitrogen (NPN), crude protein generally overestimates the actual protein content of a feed. Density A measure of the concentration of matter per unit of volume (e.g., g/l or kg/m3) Diarrhea Pathologically excessive evacuation of watery feces. Diarrhea may be due to an infectious agent (bacterial infection) or a dietary imbalance. Digesta The mixture of digestive secretion, bacterial population and feeds undergoing digestion in the gastro-intestinal tract (such as rumen content). Digestibility (Coefficient Of) A measure of the proportion of a feed that is digestible. The digestibility of a nutrient is often measured as the difference between the amount of nutrient ingested minus the amount of nutrient excreted in the feces, expressed as a percentage of the nutrient ingested: 100 x (intake - excreted)/intake. Dry Cow A non-lactating cow. The dry period is the time between lactation, when the cow is not secreting milk. Dry Matter That part of the feed which is not water. It is usually determined by the residual weight of a sample placed for a period of time in a drying oven that removes the water from the sample. Usually, the dry matter content of a feed is expressed as a percentage. For example, an hay of 85% dry matter contains 85 g of dry matter for each 100 g of fresh feed. Dry Matter Basis A method of expressing the concentration of a nutrient in a feed. For example, a feed containing 12% crude protein on a dry matter basis contains 12 g of protein for each 100 g of feed dry matter Dry Matter Intake Quantity of dry matter ingested by a cow in a 24 h period. For example, a cow eating 18 kg of grass silage of 33% of dry matter ingest 18 x 0.33 = 6 kg of grass silage dry matter. Duodenum First part of the small intestine. The secretions of the liver and pancreas are discharged into the duodenum. Ear (Of Corn) The seed-bearing part of a cereal plant. An ear of corn is composed of the grains, the cob, but not the husk, which are removed during harvesting. Embryo An organism, animal or vegetal, at its early stage of development. Endosperm The nutritive tissue of a plant seed, surrounding and absorbed by the embryo. Energy Density A measure of the concentration of energy in a feed or a ration usually expressed as a unit of energy (megacalorie or megajoule) per lb of dry matter or per kg of dry matter. Enrollment Plan Method used to select cows which are eligible for hormonal treatment (such as Ovsynch). For example, the enrollment plan may be defined by the voluntary waiting period or a negative pregnancy check. Enzyme Usually a protein that accelerates a biochemical reaction at body temperature, without being used up in the process (see also catalyst). Epithelium Membranous tissue, usually in a single layer, composed of closely arranged cells separated by very little intercellular substance. The epithelium forms the lining of the respiratory, intestinal, and urinary tracts and the outer surface of the body. Excretion The removal of a material from an organism. Example of material excreted include tears, urine, feces, sweat and carbon dioxide. Examples of an organism's organs involved in excretion include eyes, bladder, rectum, skins and lungs. False Negative An animal that tests as negative but who is actually positive. The percent of false negative for a test can be calculated as 100 -- SENSITIVITY. False Positive An animal that tests as positive but who is actually negative. The percent of false positive for a test can be calculated as 100 -- SPECIFICITY. Fat 1. Ester of glycerol and fatty acids. 2. Organic compound containing carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, but as opposed to the carbohydrates, fats have a ratio of hydrogen to oxygen well above 2:1. Fats, as opposed to oils, are solids at room temperature and usually are of animal origin. Fatty Acid A chain of carbon terminated by an acid (carboxyl) group (COOH). Fatty acids with less than 4 carbon units are volatile. Fatty acids with 5 to 20 carbon units are usually found as part of fats and oils. Fermentation (In The Rumen) The transformation of carbohydrates in absence of oxygen by rumen micro flora that produces volatile fatty acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid, and gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Fetus The unborn young. Fiber (Dietary) Nutrient of low energy density present in large quantities in forages. Fiber is composed of structural carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose) and phenolic compounds. Fiber is important for dairy cows because they stimulate rumination and promote a healthy rumen environment for bacterial growth. However, in large amounts in the diet, fiber may fill the rumen, limit intake of energy and constrain milk production. Fibrous Carbohydrate Hemicellulose and cellulose that can be quantify by the neutral detergent fiber procedure. Fodder Coarse feeds, such as straw, corn or sorghum stalks. Forage Feed that stimulate rumination due to their long particle size and their high content in fiber. Generally, forages are composed of the leaves and stems (stalk of plants. The bacterial population of the rumen allows the ruminant to digest forages. Forage To Concentrate Ratio Usually expressed as two percentages. The percentage of ration dry matter that is made up of forage and the percentage of ration dry matter that is composed of concentrates. The two total 100. For example a 50:50 forage to concentrate ratio means that a cow eating 20 kg of dry matter of that ration would eat 10 kg of concentrate dry matter and 10 kg of forage dry matter. Fructans Is a polymer of fructose molecules generally, but not always, found as \"carbohydrate storage in cool season grasses (C3 plants). Tall fescue and perennial ryegrass tend to have the highest levels of fructans when compared to other grasses under the same conditions. Fructan is stored in vacuoles inside cells throughout the plant where it is readily available as needed. In some species of grass the lower part of the stem is a carbohydrate storage organ. Fructose (C6h12o6) A sweet sugar occurring in many fruits and honey. Gastrointestinal Tract The stomach and the intestine as a functional unit. Germ the embryo of a plant present in the seed.

Gramineae Family of plants including rye grass, fescue, brome, timothy and other herbaceous plants often referred to as grass. Cereals are gramineous plants but often, they are considered apart from the grass because they are cropped for the grain rather than the vegetative parts of the plant. Grass Any of the numerous plants of the family gramineae, characteristically having narrow leaves and hollow, jointed stems (e.g., orchardgrass, ryegrass, bromegrass). Hay A sun-dried forage. A method of preserving forage by cutting the plant and letting it dry in the sun.

Legume A plant of the family leguminosae which bears a pod that splits into two valves with the seed attached to lower edge of one of the valves (examples: pea, bean, clover, alfalfa, lespedeza). Also, legumes are characterized by the nodules on their roots that allow these plants to use atmospheric nitrogen reducing the need for nitrogen fertilizer and improving soil fertility. Lignin Indigestible phenolic compound which, as the plant matures, is deposited in the cell wall and is responsible for the decrease in digestibility of the cell wall carbohydrates. Limestone A sedimentary rock, chiefly calcium carbonate (CaCO3), containing variable amounts of magnesium. It is used as building stone, but also as a source of calcium in ration of animals.

Maintenance (State) A physiological state in which the animal is neither gaining nor losing weight, performing work or expending nutrients for any type of production. Mammals A class of vertebrate animals distinguished by self-regulating body temperature, hair, and in the female (a) milk producing gland(s). Mastication To grind or crush (food) with or as if with the teeth to prepare it for swallowing and digestion (Syn: Chew).

Mcal Abbreviation for Megacalorie. Meal 1. The episodes of feed ingestion throughout the day. 2. The edible seed or other edible part of a grain, coarsely ground (as opposed to flour which is finely ground). Mean (Statistics) The mean of a normal distribution is the most likely value (the value that has the lowest probability of being \"wrong\"). The mean is the best measure of central tendency of a normal distribution. With a normal distribution, approximately one-half of the samples have values lower than the mean and one-half have values higher than the mean. Megacalorie One million calories. Metabolism Refers to all of the changes that nutrients undergo after they are absorbed from the digestive tract. Metabolism is divided into anabolism and catabolism. Metabolite A product of metabolism of nutrients. Metabolizable Protein In ruminant nutrion, metabolizable protein, often abbreviated MP, is the amount of digestible protein that reach the small intestine, which is the source of amino acids absorbed into the blood. The three main sources of MP include rumen undegraded protein (the dietary protein fraction that has not been degraded in the rumen), the microbial (bacterial) protein synthesized in the rumen from the fermentation process, and the endogenous protein (intestinal digestive enzymes and sloughed cells from the gastro-intestinal tract). The latter source is minimal. Metritis Inflammation of the uterus. Microbe Animal or vegetal organism of microscopic dimension (syn Microorganism). Microorganism (see Microbe). Milk Fever Condition that occurs immediately or within the first day after calving. The cow has cold ears and a dry muzzle. This condition is due to a calcium imbalance. As opposed to what the name implies, there is no \"fever\", but rather a paralysis of the limbs. Mill (A) 1. A building equipped with the machinery for grinding grain into flour or meal. 2. A device or mechanism such as rotating millstones, that grinds grain. Mill (To) To grind, pulverize or break down into smaller particle size in a mill. Mineral 1.

Minerals play major roles in numerous metabolic processes. (syn Ash). Monogastric Having one digestive cavity (i.e., one stomach). Morbidity Morbidity is an incidence of ill health. It is measured in various ways, often by the probability that a randomly selected individual in a population at some date and location would become seriously ill in some period of time. Contrast to mortality. Mortality is incidence of death in a population. It is measured in various ways, often by the probability that a randomly selected individual in a population at some date and location would die in some period of time. Contrast to morbidity. Multiparous (Cow) A cow that has given birth more than once. Net Energy Of Lactation (Nel) The amount of energy in a feed which is available for milk production and body maintenance. Feeds generally are similar in total energy content but vary widely in the proportion of the total energy which is available for maintenance and milk production. The remainder of the energy in the feed is lost in the feces urine, gas belched form the rumen and excess heat production by the cow. In the cow, it takes 0.74 Mcal NEl to produce 1 kg of milk containing 4% fat and the net energy content of most feed range from 0.9 to 2.2 Mcal NEl per kg dry matter. Neutral Detergent Fiber (Ndf) A measure of the amount of cell wall in a feed determined by a laboratory procedure. Neutral detergent fiber includes cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Non-Fiber Carbohydrate Carbohydrates that are not part of the neutral detergent fiber, but generally accumulate in the plant as energy reserve (e.g., starch). These carbohydrates usually are more rapidly and more completely digested than the fibrous carbohydrates (syn Non-structural carbohydrate). Non-Protein Nitrogen (Npn) Nitrogen that comes from a source other than protein but may be used by a ruminant in the building of protein. NPN sources include compounds such as urea and anhydrous ammonia, which are used in feed formulations for ruminant only. Non-Structural Carbohydrate (see non-fiber carbohydrate). Nutrient The chemical substances found in feeds that can be used, and are necessary, for the maintenance, production and health of the animal. The main classes of nutrients are carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals, vitamins and water. Nutrient Requirement This refers to meeting the animal's need of the various classes of nutrients for maintenance, growth, reproduction, lactation and physical work. Obese extremely fat. Oil Lipid, usually of vegetal origin, which is liquid at room temperature (as opposed to fats). Omasum The third stomach of a ruminant between the reticulum and the abomasum. It is characterized by the presence of muscular leaves that may have an absorptive function. Organic Matter Compounds composed of carbon oxygen hydrogen and nitrogen. All living organisms are composed primarily of organic matter. Fats, carbohydrates and proteins are examples of organic compounds. Orts This is a German word that refers to leftovers of a meal. In dairy nutrition the orts is the amount of feed refused from a daily offering. In dairy nutrition research, orts must be sampled and analyzed in order to calculate with precision the consumption of dry matter and nutrients by the cow. Orts expressed as a percent of dry matter offered is a criteria to determine whether an animal was fed ad libitum (Syn: refusals). Ovulation Release of an oocyte (i.e., egg) from a mature follicle. In dairy cows, ovulation occurs 24 to 32 hours after the first standing event of behavioral estrous. Similarly, ovulation occurs 24 to 32 hours after an injection of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone; (Gn-RH) administered in the presence of a dominant follicle. Palatability The taste and flavor property of a feedstuffs that make them more or less acceptable to be eaten. Pancreas An irregularly shaped gland that secretes pancreatic juice into the duodenum and produces insulin that is released into the blood. Papillae (Reticulo-Rumen) 1. Small projections on the inner surface of the rumen and the reticulum wall that increase the surface area of absorption of volatile fatty acids and other end-products of bacterial fermentation. Papillae (Tongue) Protuberances at the surface of the tongue that detect the taste of a feed. Parturition The act of giving birth (Syn Calving). Pepsin A digestive enzyme found in the gastric juice that breaks down proteins into peptides. Peptide 1. At least 2 but not more that 100 amino acids linked together by a peptic bound. 2.

Phenolic (Compound) Organic substance in which the carbon atoms are linked together in a ring structure (also called aromatic structure). Lignin is an example of phenolic compound. Photosynthesis The process by which the chlorophyll of plants converts carbon dioxide and water into simple sugars with the simultaneous release of oxygen. Placenta An organ that develops during pregnancy in female mammals. It lines the uterus and partially envelopes the fetus, to which it is attached by the umbilical cord. Following birth, the placenta, then called the after birth, is normally expelled. The retention of the placenta usually leads to bacterial infection of the uterus called metritis. Pod The structure that contains the seeds of leguminous plants. It usually splits open after drying of the plant. Polish (To) To free from coarseness; to refine. Polygastric Having more than one digestive cavity; Having a stomach divided into different chambers (e.g., ruminants). Population (Statistics) The set of individuals, items, or data from which a statistical sample is taken. In statistical terms, a population is defined as a larger set from which samples are obtained. Pregnant Having one or several fetus growing inside the uterus. Primiparous (Cow) 1. A young cow that is pregnant for the first time. 2. A cow that has given birth once. Protease Digestive enzyme that breakdown proteins into peptides. Protein A chain or multiple chains of amino acids (more than 100). Proteins are composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen nitrogen (16% on average,found in the form of amino acids) and often sulfur. Proteins have important functions in the body. They are present in all plants and animals and they are essential in the ration of animals. See also Crude Protein. Protozoan Most primitive form of life in the animal kingdom composed of only one microscopic cell. Pylorus The passage connecting the stomach (abomasum) to the duodenum. Radicle The part of a plant embryo that develops into the primary root. Regurgitation Reversal of the natural direction in which contents flow through a tube or a cavity in the body. During rumination, rumen contents are regurgitated through the esophagus in the mouth for further mastication. Reticulo-Rumen The first two stomachs of a ruminant comprised of the reticulum and the rumen. A microbial population lives in the rumen and enable the cow to digest dietary fiber. The digesta in the rumen and the reticulum is being exchanged once about every 50 to 60 seconds under the influence of a rhythmic cycle of contraction which also results in passage of some digesta from the reticulum into the omasum through the reticulo-omasal orifice. Reticulum The second stomach of a ruminant in which folds of the mucous membrane form hexagonal cells. Also called honeycomb stomach. The reticulum is joined to the omasum by the reticulo-omasal orifice. Rhizobium A type of bacteria that live in association with the roots of legume plants and make the nitrogen of the air available to the plants. Rhizome A root-like usually horizontal stem growing under or along the ground that sends out roots from its lower surfaces and leaves or shoots from its upper surface. Rickets A deficiency disease resulting from a lack of vitamin D or lack of sunshine exposure, characterized by defective bone growth. Root Part of the plant, usually under ground that maintain the plant, withdraw water and other nutrient from the soil, and sometimes accumulate reserves of nutrients. Rumen The large first compartment of the stomach of a ruminant from which food is regurgitated and in which cellulose in broken down by the action of the symbiotic bacterial, protozoa, and fungal populations. Scour see diarrhea. Secretion The movement of a material from one place to another. Secretion is often required to move a material to the place where it can be excreted. Examples of materials secreted include all materials excreted (see Excretion above), plus enzymes, hormones and saliva. The organs that play a role in secretion include all those involved in excretion, plus the digestive glands like salivary glands, pancreas, liver and gallbladder and endocrine glands like the thyroid gland, pituitary gland, and ovaries and testes. Seed A fertilized and ripened plant ovule containing an embryo capable of germinating to produce a new plant. Sensitivity The probability that a test is positive, given that the animal has the disease (See also specificity). Serum The clear yellowish fluid obtained upon separating the clotted whole blood into its liquid and solid (red and white blood cells) components. Silage Method of preservation of fresh forages based on the partial fermentation of the sugars in absence of oxygen. Silage can be made in various silos. Silo Structure constructed to help preserving forages as silage. Different types of silos includes: Tower silo, oxygen limiting silo, trench silo, etc. Sinus A cavity formed by a bending or curving; a dilated passage. Somatic Cells (a) Any of the cells of a plant or animal except the reproductive cells. (b) Milk somatic cells are primarily leukocytes (white blood cells) and some epithelial cells shed from the lining of the mammary gland. The leukocytes are derived from blood and consist of macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear cells, primarily neutrophils (PMN). Normal milk does contain somatic cells, and the concentration of these cells is almost always less than 100,000 cells/ml in milk from uninfected/uninflamed mammary quarters. Specificity The probability that a test is negative, given that the animal does not have the disease (see also sensitivity). Sphincter A ring-like muscle that maintains constriction of a bodily passage or orifice and opens upon relaxation. Sprout (To) To grow or to develop quickly (syn to germinate). Stalk The main stem of an herbaceous plant. Starch Carbohydrate found chiefly in seeds, fruits, tubers, roots, an stem pith of plants notably in corn, potatoes, wheat and rice. Warm season grasses (C4 plants) store starch in chloroplasts in leaf tissue. C4 grasses such as Bermuda Paspalum or Rhodes grasses grown under heat stress may contain considerable starch in leafy tissue. Nutritionally, it is referred to as non-structural carbohydrate as opposed to the carbohydrate found in the neutral detergent fiber of the plant. Stem The main upward growing axis of a plant, usually above the ground and in direction opposite of the roots. Stillborn Calf A calf born dead or that dies within 48 hours of birth. Stover Fodder; mature-cured stalks from which seeds have been removed, such as stalks of corn or stalk of sorghum without heads. Straw The plant residue remaining after separation of the seeds in threshing. It includes chaff. Structural Carbohydrate (see Fibrous carbohydrate). Subclinical Without clinical manifestations; said of the early stages or a very mild form of a disease, e.g. subclinical disease, infection, parasitism, or when a disease is detectable by biological tests but not by a clinical examination. Symbiosis The intimate living together of two dissimilar organism in any of various mutually beneficial relationships. Tannin Highly complex phenolic compounds in plants that may play a role of defense again microorganisms and possible predators (the herbivores). Tannin binds and reduces the availability of proteins and carbohydrates to ruminal microbes. Taste Property of feed detected by some papillae of the tongue and the roof of the mouth resulting in a positive or negative response to further ingestion of the feed. Thyroid Gland A two-lobed gland located in the throat and secreting the hormone thyroxin, which regulates the iodine metabolism in the body. Timed Artificial Insemination Method of AI breeding in which the timing of artificial insemination (AI) is based on a hormonal protocol that synchronizes the timing of ovulation. This is in contrast to timing insemination based on direct or indirect detection of estrous behavior. Hormonal protocols for Timed AI were developed in 1995 and have been widely adopted by dairy producers for reproductive management. Total Mixed Ration (Tmr) Mixture of the forages, concentrates, minerals and vitamin supplements of a ration. The total mixed ration has the advantage of offering a balanced ration at each meal rather than on a 24 h basis. Triglyceride A fat composed of three fatty acids and glycerol. Trypsin Digestive enzyme secreted by the pancreas and responsible for the break down of peptide bonds of proteins. Some plants contain a trypsin inhibitor that prevent trypsin from functioning properly. Udder Mammary gland of a cow. Ultra-Violet: Ray in sunlight which enables vitamin D to be synthesized under the skin. Underfeeding Usually refers to feeding insufficient energy. Unsaturated Fat Fat containing fatty acids that can accept hydrogen atoms to saturate their structure (e.g., oleic, linoleic, linolenic and arachidonic acids). Urea [Co(Nh2)2] A nitrogen-containing organic compound found in urine and other body fluids. Urea is synthesized from ammonia and carbon dioxide. Urea can be used as fertilizer or as a source of nitrogen in the ration of ruminants. Vegetative The parts of plants that are involved in the growth as opposed to the parts of plants involved in reproduction. Very Low Density Lipoprotein (Vldl) Particles that carry cholesterol and fat throughout the bloodstream. These particles are released from the liver into the bloodstream. They are similar to chylomicrons which originate from the gut because they both carry cholesterol and triglycerides which are gradually released in the bloodstream to be absorbed by body cells along the way. In the process of losing triglycerides, the VLDLs grow smaller and turn into LDLs (Low Density Lipoprotein) which have lost all their triglycerides. Vitamins Complex organic substances occurring naturally in plants and animal tissue and essential in small amounts for the proper functioning of numerous metabolic processes. Volatile Evaporating readily at normal temperature and pressure. Volatile Fatty Acids (Vfa) Products of fermentation of carbohydrates (and some amino acids) by the rumen microorganisms. Acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid are the primary volatile fatty acids which are absorbed through the rumen wall and used as an energy source by the cow. Voluntary Waiting Period The number of days between calving and first attempt to breed a cow. A typical voluntary waiting period is 45 days. However, it may varies from less than 40 to 80 days depending on farmer's preference and reproductive protocol in place on the farm. Whey The liquid fraction that remains after the separation of curd in cheese making. Its main food use is in the preparation of whey cheese, whey drinks and fermented whey drinks. The main industrial uses are in the manufacture of lactose, whey paste and dried whey.
