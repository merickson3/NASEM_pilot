Danes, Universidade Federal de Lavras 2023-05-23 Chapter 1 About this interactive textbook Figure 1.1: Cover of 'Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle, 8th edition' 1.1 Overview The NASEM (2021) \"Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle\" consensus report is a distillation of our collective knowledge about dairy cattle nutrition in the U.S. in the form of written text and mathematical equations. The most recent edition (8th), hereafter referred to as NASEM (2021), includes two parts. First, a 502 page consensus report book describes advancements in the dairy nutrition literature in recent decades in the form of narrative text and prediction equations. Second, a software for Windows enables users to evaluate diet adequacy for a given scenario based on the equations explained in the book. Our interactive textbook and its accompanying resources for teachers are intended to promote learning from the NASEM (2021) materials. Because the NASEM (2021) narrative and software were designed for advanced dairy nutrition practitioners, they may be difficult for less-experienced learners. Our interactive textbook is designed to highlight core concepts that will assist learners in understanding the NASEM narrative and utilizing the mathematical model in practice. Learning Objectives of this interactive textbook Raise learners' knowledge and confidence working with nutritional models, using the example of the NASEM (2021) \"Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle\" 1.2 Information for educators Intended audience This interactive textbook is for anyone interested in learning about nutritional science and nutritional modeling. Although is discusses a dairy cattle nutritional model, it is NOT designed solely for dairy-interested learners. As the \"Requirements\" chapter illustrates, there is substantial overlap in how scientists describe nutritional processes for humans and other animal species. Throughout the textbook, we emphasized critical thinking about nutritional science rather than memorization of any particular dairy cattle nutrition facts. Therefore, we hope this interactive textbook will be interesting and relevant for learners regardless of their interest in dairy cattle. Assumptions about prior knowledge This textbook can be used by anyone, but it has been designed with the assumption that learners have some prior knowledge. Before starting this material, we suggest that learners should have: Intermediate understanding of nutritional physiology of ruminants, e.g., have taken an animal nutrition course Intermediate knowledge of dairy production systems, e.g., through an introductory animal science or management-focused course, or through personal/career-related experiences Basic skills with statistics and math (mean, standard deviation, regression) Technology requirements To read the narrative and complete activities, need a computer and stable internet connection To run NASEM-8 software, need Windows operating system 1.3 NASEM Components Figure 1.2: Components of 'Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle, 8th edition.' The consensus report book includes (A) narrative text reviewing scientific literature used in creating the model, (B) Feed Tables with ingredient composition data. The book was also released with (C) Windows software. 1.3.1 Accessing the NASEM (2021) book The NASEM (2021) book provides a narrative that summarizes recent scientific literature on dairy nutrition and justifies choices made while developing the mathematical model. The narrative is rich with information on nutritional physiology, dairy herd management, dairy nutrition experimentation, and the model development process. Due to its information density and use of technical language, it may be overwhelming to read for less-experienced practitioners. For this reason, learners may find it helpful to read the NASEM (2021) book in a class or small-group setting where it is possible to ask questions and verify their understanding. Instructors and learners can work together to determine which sections of the text are appropriate to the learners' current comprehension level. For intermediate learners, it may be best to read this interactive textbook first before spending much time reading the NASEM (2021) narrative. Advanced learners may be able to read through the NASEM (2021) Consensus Report simultaneous to completing the activities in it. In some cases, learners may benefit from approaching the narrative in an informal \"Journal Club\"-style setting (arranged either by teachers or students!). Accessing NASEM (2021) consensus report At the time of writing, a print version of the NASEM 8th edition book is available for purchase at the link below. Eventually this material will be available to read for free online. https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25806/nutrient-requirements-of-dairy-cattle-eighth-revised-edition Earlier editions, e.g., 7th, NRC (2001) Earlier editions of \"Nutrient Requirements for Dairy Cattle\" are available to read for free online, for example, the 7th edition (2001): https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/9825/nutrient-requirements-of-dairy-cattle-seventh-revised-edition-2001 1.3.2 Accessing NASEM-dairy-8 software Most of this interactive textbook can be completed without using the NASEM-dairy-8 software. However, learners are encouraged to download and experiment with the NASEM dairy-8 software on their own time. Download instructions are available on the NASEM website. The NASEM dairy-8 software runs only on Windows operating system. Learners who wish to run NASEM dairy-8 can install it on a personal computer or a campus library computer. Learners with non-Windows operating system may be able to download the NASEM dairy-8 using virtual machines through platforms such as Virtual Box (https://www.virtualbox.org). However, this requires substantial computer expertise and may be inconvenient for everyday use. Accessing NASEM-dairy-8 software The NASEM-dairy-8 software for Windows is available to download as shown here: https://nap.nationalacademies.org/resource/25806/Installation_Instructions_NASEM_Dairy8.pdf Earlier software, e.g., NASEM-dairy-7 It is also possible to download the Windows software for NRC (2001), although NASEM recommendeds against having both NRC 2001 and NASEM 2021 software installed on the same computer. https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/9825/nutrient-requirements-of-dairy-cattle-seventh-revised-edition-2001 1.4 Examples 1.4.1 NASEM dairy-8 The easiest way to get started running NASEM-8 is to Load a pre-defined simulation.The software comes with several pre-defined simulations for different classes of animals (e.g., \"Example Lactating Cow 100 DIM\"). Loading a pre-defined simulation pre-loads all of the inputs describing an example animal, management scenario, and diet. This can be helpful to avoid entering unrealistic inputs. To run NASEM-8, users proceed through four sections: Inputs. In the first panel, users must specify the Program Settings. Most commonly, the default settings (Metric, Dry Matter) can be retained. In the second panel of Inputs, \"Animal Description/Management\" users can provide detail about the animal (e.g., age, breed, days in milk) and the management scenario (e.g., grazing vs. no grazing). Finally, the \"Production\" panel allows users to specify the expected rates of growth, changes in body reserves, and milk and component production. Feeds. In this section, users can select the feedstuffs that will comprise the ration (\"Add Feeds to Ration\"). The software is pre-loaded with a default Feed Library, which contains composition information for over 300 feeds commonly used in dairy rations. Ingredients in the feed library can be modified to create custom feeds (\"Edit feed components and nutrients\"), which users can save to the feed library (Save Feed in Feed Library) for later use. This section defines which feeds are used in the ration, but not the inclusion rates. Ration. Feeds selected in the prior section will appear in the Ration List. To create a ration, users enter either the amount of dry matter (DM) consumed or the feed's percent of total diet DM. The bottom of the screen allows users to specify DMI manually (\"Total Intake\") or to select from two estimated intakes produced by the NASEM model using the animal characteristics (e.g., milk production, parity, body weight). Using the \"Set to 100%\" allows users to easily scale diet information to 100%. This can be helpful to correct rounding errors (e.g., to fix ingredient composition that sums to 100.01 or 99.99% of DM). A sidebar shows quick estimates of the diet nutritional value, which makes it easier to tweak the ingredient composition to meet goals. Reports. Finally, users can generate reports detailing the predictions from the NASEM (2021) model. Nine types of reports are available. By selecting \"10. All\" and \"Generate Selected Reports,\" a Word document is created and opened. Users can look through the Word document to see predicted nutrient supplies and requirements associated with their inputs. It is also possible to generate an excel spreadsheet with the nutrient composition of ingredients. This may be helpful for users who wish to do their own manual calculations. Some of the most common mistakes when using NASEM dairy-8 relate to improper inputs. For example, a user could enter a body weight of 7,000 instead of 700 kg in the Animal Description; or create a custom feed with unrealistic nutrient composition. For this reason, it is easiest to use pre-loaded simulations and default Feed Library ingredients in classroom settings. This will prevent many hours of troubleshooting related to improper inputs. NOTE: Even with perfectly-matched inputs, the NASEM software is more up-to-date than the consensus report. For this reason, the outputs may differ slightly when using equations in the book versus the reports generated in the software. More details are given in the next section. 1.4.2 R The examples assume that the user has installed R and set the working directory to a relevant folder. However, most examples are designed to be relatively portable and work regardless of the working directory. Additionally, some library() calls are made to load required packages. If this is the first time using a package, the user needs to first install the package (install.packages(\"packagename\"), where packagename is replaced with the enquoted (\"\") name of the package to be installed). Many people run R within a developing environment such as Rstudio. Rstudio is available for download across platforms: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. The learnr package provides a nice overview of how to set up R and Rstudio: https://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r/#section-welcome Complete beginners: learn R with swirl To get started feeling more comfortable with R, I would recommend you give the \"swirl\" package a try. It is pretty fun and helps you start to grasp the basic R syntax. Use the install.packages command to install it. Then, you can use library() to call the swirl package, loading it into your workspace. From here, the swirl package should mostly guide you the rest of the way. There are several modules you can complete. The R Programming course is a good start. You can see more about the swirl package here: https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses#swirl-courses install.packages (&quot;swirl&quot;) library(swirl) install_course(&quot;R Programming&quot;) #Loading a course in &quot;swirl&quot; swirl() 1.4.3 Python The examples assume the user has installed Python and pandas. The simplest way for inexperienced users to install Python and pandas is through Anaconda. For installation instructions, see here: https://docs.continuum.io/free/anaconda/install/ For Mac, python is preinstalled. To run an example, open a terminal in the working directory (folder with input/output files in it) and call python to change the interpreter to Python. Alternatively, the examples can be run from a developing environment such as Visual Studio code. Again, it is important to ensure the working directory (if relevant for the example) has been set up. However, most examples are designed to be relatively portable and work regardless of the working directory. 1.5 Helpful information Known updates (discrepancies in book vs. software) The software is under continual improvement, whereas the book is static. According to the NASEM-8 software \"help\" documentation, the latest software and R code contains the most correct and up-to-date version of the NASEM model. NOTE: To avoid confusion, our interactive textbook will use the NASEM model equations given in the software. NASEM dairy-8 software updates and bugs Since the software was released, several updates have been made. Users should ensure they have the latest version of NASEM-8 downloaded to avoid any errors. The errors below may be encountered with older versions: With versions of NASEM-8 software downloaded prior to 2023.03.11, user-entered target milk production, milk protein production, and milk fat were silently overridden with predicted values. This resulted in NEL, urine energy, and other values reported incorrectly. This bug has been fixed by the developer in subsequent releases. In certain cases, the NEL balance in the sidebar does not match the Word document output. In certain versions of the NASEM-8 software, manure volatile solids was overwritten by manure water in tabular output in Word. Differences between the book and software The most recent software is more up-to-date than the equations in the Consensus Report book. Most updates resulted in relatively small differences in predictions as a result of fine-tuning parameters. Known differences between the book and software include: The efficiency of ME to RE is 0.75 in the software and 0.74 in the book (p. 29). The kg of CP in gravid uterus per kg of calf birth weight (CP_GrUtWt) differs from book p. 87. The kg gravid uterus weight per fetal birthweight (GrUterWt_FetBWbrth) differs from book p. 31. The energy (Mcal/kg) fresh gravid uterus weight (NE_GrUtWt) at birth differs from book p. 31. The amount of CP (kg/kg) in fresh gravid uterus weight (CP_GrUtWt) differs from book p. 87. The coefficient for digestible energy in urinary nitrogen differs from the book (p. 32?). Estimated manure output (Man_out) uses a different equation than those listed in the Environment chapter. The coefficient for NDF in the methane emission equation for heifers is positive in the book (p. 302), and negative in the software. The intercept for the methane production of non-lactating dairy cows is positive in the book (p. 302; 14-1c) and negative in the software. Additionally, note that CF is crude fat, not crude fiber! In the book (eq. 13-4, p. 304) the CP:N factor is listed as 0.638. It is 0.634 (6.34) in the software. The 6.34 factor is consistent with the Protein chapter. Other notes (not discrepant, but maybe helpful to know). 1. The book (eq. 6-13b, p. 87) gives an equation for the efficiency of AA use for non-pregnant animals. There is no corresponding equation for gestating animals in the book, but the software takes into account AA needs for gestation when appropriate. 1. The book (eq. 6-4a) has a parentheses error. The end of the equation shows a calculation of total diet NDF intake as NDF/100 * DMI. The diet NDF intake should be multiplied by the entire equation preceding, not just the last term (1.51 * DMI). This is because the first part of the equation calculates the percentage of rumen-degradable NDF out of the diet NDF. 1. The book (p. 32) abbreviates the gains/losses of reproductive tissues associated with pregnancy and involution as GrUter_Wt. The uterus is not technically gravid after parturition, therefore, gravid signifies that the uterus is still returning from pregnant to non-pregnant status. 1. The equation 3-5a on p. 25 reads \"DMI_DM\" where it should say \"DMI_BW.\" 1.6 Contribute edits and suggestions Interested in editing or adding to this interactive textbook?

List and differentiate common dairy nutritional models. Describe how nutritional models are developed, step-by-step. 2.1 A brief history Deliberate animal feeding began before recorded history with the advent of agriculture in Asia and Africa 12,000 years ago (Coffey, 2016). Since this time, humans have carefully considered how to manage forages, grains, minerals, and other natural resources to provide nourishment for domesticated animals. In regions throughout the world, traditional and indigenous knowledge systems contain a wealth of information on animal nutritional management, yet very little of it is recorded in publications and books. Primarily in the last 200 years, animal nutrition developed as a scientific discipline. The use of scientific methods enabled researchers to isolate the chemical components of feeds and to quantitatively relate dietary intakes to physiological effects. As nutrition science progressed, nutritional diseases that had once harmed or killed thousands of animals (and people) began to be curable. The productivity of agricultural animals began to increase. As per the scientific method, advances were recorded with detailed publications in the scientific literature to enable cumulative progress. In the United States, nutrition science was spurred by government efforts to reconstruct and reduce poverty after wars. In the aftermath of the Civil War and World Wars, the U.S. government chartered the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and its subsidiary organization the National Research Council (NRC, Ullrey, 2001). NASEM is a non-governmental, non-profit organization of academics whose mission is to translate scientific information into domestic policy and practice. In animal nutrition, NASEM is famous for organizing efforts to consolidate nutritional science knowledge into animal feeding recommendations by publishing consensus reports. The first edition of \"Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle\" was published by the NRC (NASEM's subsidiary) in 1945. In the eight decades following, researchers created seven more editions of this consensus report. Each edition uses the most up-to-date research on dairy cattle nutrition generated by researchers at universities and government institutions. Test yourself The 7th edition is the most recent version of the Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle. TRUEFALSE The National Academies publishes consensus reports for other species besides dairy cattle. TRUEFALSE 2.2 Definition Test Yourself: Before proceeding, we need to ask ourselves...what are nutritional models, and what do they have in common with the cave paintings shown at the beginning of the chapter? The cave painting of cattle is a two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional animals. It conveys some information about cattle and how they are shaped. Although we cannot know the intention of its artist(s), perhaps they meant to use the cave painting to communicate some information about cattle they had observed. The painting is a \"snapshot\" in time that summarizes and communicates about cattle. A nutritional model (for example, the NASEM dairy model) is also a representation of cattle. Instead of a two-dimensional artwork, nutritional models are generally represented mathematically. The tens or hundreds of mathematical expressions that comprise a nutritional model are intended to summarize and communicate what we know about cattle nutrition. Similar to the painting, a model is a representation of reality. 2.3 Usefulness Models are mathematical and/or statistical descriptions of inputs, processes, and outputs. Nutritional models function as decision-support tools that can use known information (e.g., feed composition, animal characteristics) to predict how nutritional processes will unfold and what outcomes will result. They can be used to answer various types of questions. Scenario 1 A dairy nutritionist has access to many different feedstuffs with known chemical composition. They have several different pens of animals to feed (e.g., calves, dry cows, lactating cows, high-producing lactating cows). How do they create diets for each pen of animals? A nutritional model can help determine the requirements for each pen of animals. Additionally, the nutritional model can determine which feeds can be combined to create diets that meet the requirements. Scenario 2 A group of dairy producers aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their farm so they can reach carbon-neutral production goals. How can they select diets that contribute to their environmental goals? A nutritional model could help these producers predict the environmental impact of their current production practices, or explore hypothetical alternative diets and scenarios. Scenario 3 A dairy nutritionist has a suspicion that a group of cows is not producing as much milk fat as they could be, given the diet and animal characteristics. How does the nutritionist test their hypothesis? A nutritional model can be used to benchmark production. Benchmarking means comparing the observed value against a reference value to evaluate its adequacy. In this case, the nutritionist could enter the diet and cow information to predict the expected milk fat production under these conditions. Then, they could compare this reference (expected) value to their observed value to benchmark. Scenario 4 Feed costs for certain ingredients have changed, and a nutritionist wants to ensure they can meet animal needs and maintain performance at the least possible cost. How can they create a diet that minimizes feed costs? A nutritional model can be used to optimize diets based on certain constraints. For example, least cost formulation is a common approach. It involves finding the combination of ingredients that will create a diet that meets animal requirements and costs the least amount. 2.4 NASEM (2021) and other dairy nutrition models NASEM is one of several dairy cattle nutrition models. In most cases, models are intended to serve as decision support tools. In other words, the model estimates are intended to help dairy stakeholders, especially dairy farm managers, make more-informed decisions. The Cornell Net Protein and Carbohydrate System (CNCPS) is an alternative model upon which commercial ration formulation programs such as AMTS have been built. CNCPS also influence the development of The Large Ruminant Nutrition System (LRNS) by Texas A&amp;M researchers. In recent years, the importance of evaluating the environmental and economic impacts of dairy production have led to the development of models not just focused on the animal-level variables (as with NASEM), but instead integrating information about the entire farm system. These models, for example, the Ruminant Farm Systems (RuFaS) model, incorporate detailed information about local weather, soil characteristics, crop growth and storage, and prices of feedstuffs. Some programs allow users to optimize the inclusion rate of selected diet ingredients (e.g., least cost ration formulation; AMTS program). In contrast, NASEM is designed to evaluate existing diets rather than formulate new diets that optimize user-defined parameters or meet user-defined constraints. Additionally, NASEM predicts selected environmental impacts at the individual animal, predominantly based on dietary factors. Thus, NASEM predictions of environmental impacts do not integrate farm system information to the same extent as other models, e.g., RuFaS.

To get a sense of how nutritional models work, let's go through a fictional example and develop our own (very simple!) nutritional model. We need to follow the following steps: Hypothesis generation Data collection (through observation and experimentation) Model development Model verification and generation of new hypotheses ...repeat the process ad infinitum 2.5.1 Hypothesis generation Imagine that a researcher has some cattle in individual stalls. They ensure each cow has as much feed as she wants to consume (ad libitum feeding). Over time, the researcher starts to notice that the larger cattle seem to eat more. They write this observation into their notebook. What the researcher has just done is the rough beginning of generating a hypothesis: Larger cows seem to consume more feed than smaller cows. After thinking about it some more, they can refine their hypothesis to make it more testable. For example, rather than \"larger cows\", which is somewhat vague, they can be more specific and say \"greater bodyweight.\" Rather than saying \"eat more,\" they can say \"consume more dry matter on a daily basis.\" Now, we have a testable hypothesis: In lactating cows, greater bodyweight is associated with greater dry matter intake on a daily basis. By gathering empirical data, we can test this hypothesis. If we find evidence that this relationship is true, we can use it to build a nutritional model. 2.5.2 Data collection through observation (or experimentation) To learn more about the hypothesized relationship between body size and feed intake, the researcher decides to find a larger group of cattle to collect observational data. They collect two pieces of information in each observation: 1) the animal's body weight (BW), and 2) the animal's dry matter intake (DMI). They use the data to create a plot: Figure 2.2: DMI vs BW for 300 observations from lactating cows Think to Yourself: What would you conclude from the plot? After looking at the plot, the researcher believes that it supports their hypothesis: DMI and BW are positively related. In other words, if an animal's BW is known, its DMI can be guessed with some accuracy. The researcher decides to convert this observed relationship to a mathematical model. Because the relationship seems to follow a line, they fit a regression with the linear form \\(y = mx + b\\). Figure 2.3: Fitted regression model predicting DMI from BW for lactating cows 2.5.3 Model development By fitting a regression model to the observed points, they get an estimate of the slope (0.03) that relates BW and DMI. In other words, the average DMI observed was 3% of the animal BW. This single mathematical expression is a very simple nutritional model: \\(DMI = 0.03 * BW\\) We can think of our example model as an expression relating three parameters: \\(DMI\\) a predicted value \\(0.03\\) a coefficient relating DMI and BW \\(BW\\) a user input describing the animal The researcher thinks the model will be useful for prediction. They decide to test the predictive performance of the model by buying a new lactating cow. They record the cow's BW as 625 kg. Figure 2.4: Fitted regression model predicting DMI from BW for lactating cows Test Yourself: Using our simple nutritional model, what is this cow's predicted DMI? 2.5.4 Model verification To predict the DMI of the new cow, the researcher enters the known information (cow's BW) into the nutritional model: \\(DMI = 0.03 * 625\\). The model predicts the cow's DMI will be 18.75 kg. Tracing up from the x-axis, the intersection of the red dashed line with the blue line shows the predicted DMI for an animal with BW = 625. Next, the researcher decides to verify their model by measuring the animal's actual DMI. Figure 2.5: Actual DMI for a new observation (red point) of a cow with BW = 625 kg Uh oh.... the actual DMI observed is shown with the large red point. It is greater than the prediction. This means that the model under-predicted the actual DMI for this cow based on her BW. This causes the researcher to go back to their original model, \\(DMI = 0.03 * BW\\). The variable BW seems to explain some, but not all of the variation in DMI. Test Yourself: What should the researcher do next? There are several courses of action to be considered. First, the researcher could leave the model as-is, and attribute the error in prediction to un-explainable variation. Un-explainable variation comes from unknown and un-measurable sources, including the intrinsic randomness of the universe. Second, the researcher could try to gather more information to find other measurable predictors of DMI besides BW. Then, they could revise the nutritional model to include other variables that determine the DMI. 2.5.5 Model refinement (re-starting the process) Generally, scientists take the second option. In our example, the researcher might go back to their notebook and consider... what other factors could be affecting DMI aside from BW? Eventually, they would develop a new hypothesis, for example: younger, first-lactation animals will consume less than more mature animals with two or more lactations. They plot the data again, including information about the animals' parity: Figure 2.6: DMI vs BW for 300 observations from lactating cows, by parity It appears there is some variation explained by parity. In this way, the researcher can update the model to include other parameters, e.g., \\(DMI = 0.03 * BW + ParityEffect\\). Our example model now includes four parameters: \\(DMI\\) a predicted value \\(0.03\\) a coefficient relating DMI and BW \\(BW\\) a user input describing the animal \\(ParityEffect\\) a parameter that adjusts the intercept up for multiparous, and down for primiparous cows. When it comes to updating our model from here, the possibilities are almost limitless. Parameters can refer to any part of the animal system: the model inputs, intermediates, outputs, and relationships among these quantities. Almost anything we can measure in animal nutrition (an amount, a rate, a status) can be thought of as a parameter. As we can see from the example, parameters are not always numeric. Inputs such as \\(Parity = multiparous, primiparous\\), \\(Breed = Holstein\\), and \\(Life\\space Stage = Calf\\) are categories rather than numbers. As we'll see in later chapters, nutritional models can accommodate many different types of information (e.g, numerical, categorical), various types of relationships between parameters (e.g., additive, interactive), using many types of mathematical expressions (e.g., linear, non-linear). 2.5.6 Reflecting on our example model Congratulations - you created and used your first nutritional model! 🎉 Just like the two-dimensional cow paintings at the beginning, our simple nutritional model conveyed some information about cattle. Instead of a painting, we used a mathematical expression to communicate it. We showed how a researcher could use empirical observations (data collection) to create a model expression, check it against new data, and refine the model. 2.6 Scaling up and adding complexity How do we get from our simple example model, to a huge and complex model like NASEM? In our example, one researcher was working alone. In actuality, thousands of animal nutritionists and researchers contribute to developing nutritional models such as NASEM (2021). Many researchers have a specific focus area (e.g., fatty acid nutrition, rumen function) and dedicate their efforts to improving methods and collecting data for this specific topic area. An individual researcher can only collect a limited amount of data on a few parameters. Still, when thousands of researchers publish their findings, these models and data can be aggregated into larger models. In fact, some researchers (\"modelers\") specialize in aggregating and modeling data collected by other scientists! The NASEM model is a conglomeration of many smaller models (sometimes called sub-models) into one larger model. The entire NASEM model is massive: it represents all nutrients and energy for all nutritional processes. It contains hundreds of parameters, related by many types of mathematical expressions. In contrast, any given piece (a sub-model) of the NASEM model is simpler. A sub-model could represent only one nutrient (e.g., protein) or a specific process (e.g., ruminal degradation). Many of the sub-models can be further divided into smaller sub-models. Each of these tiny pieces of the NASEM model was created and refined through scientific processes similar to our example model. Modelers worked to connect together these tiny sub-models to create the much larger NASEM model. Test yourself A NASEM sub-model is someone else's duplicate of the original model. TRUEFALSE 2.7 Conclusion Nutritional models serve practical goals: they can make animal feeding practices more economical, more environmentally-sound, and more aligned with human needs and available resources. Nutritional models are developed through scientific processes. They use mathematical expressions to represent information about how nutritional processes work. Nutritional models can appear quite complex, but it's important to remember that they are the collective effort of many people, across long periods of time, as documented in the scientific literature. 2.8 Questions What historical events spurred the development of animal nutrition sciences in the U.S.?

Explain physical/chemical and biological principles that apply across animal nutrition. Give specific examples of 1) inputs, 2) outputs, and 3) means by which the system is transformed for a dairy ruminant. 3.1 The animal nutritional system In the last chapter, we created a simple nutritional model that represented three pieces of information: feed intake, body weight, and parity. Yet as animal scientists, we have access to much more information about feeds, animals, and outcomes than just these three variables. As we start to build more complex models that include more variables, we will quickly confront a problem...how can we organize the many different pieces of information we can collect about an animal's nutrition? In this chapter, we will begin to think about the animal as a nutritional system. Specifically, we will consider the boundaries of nutritional knowledge, discuss guiding principles, and sketch out the configuration of a single-animal nutritional system, using dairy cattle examples. 3.2 Ways of understanding nutritional systems Disciplines such as physics, economics, and animal nutrition each have their own ways of seeing the world. Animal nutrition is an applied discipline, so nutritionists make use of tools from various other disciplines to achieve practical goals. For a nutritionist, the most interesting aspects of an animal are the physical, chemical, and biological processes through which the organism intakes nutrients uses them to support its life. Physical properties can be observed or measured without changing the composition of the substance. For example, freezing water changes its physical properties, but not its chemical composition. In contrast, chemical changes involve the substance reacting with other substances to change chemical composition. Finally, biological processes involve both physics and chemistry, and they are enacted in a living organism. In practice, animal nutritionists manage many different aspects of animal systems, including social and economic components. For example, a dairy nutritionist in California might formulate rations that include lots of almond hulls, because this is a cheap feed source (economic) that is a byproduct of a process that humans value (social). A nutritionist might change the ingredient composition of diets based on the desire of some people for grass-fed milk (social). A nutritional model such as NASEM (2021) does not take into account economic or social factors. It is based solely on physical, chemical, and biological properties of the animal system. Ways of knowing represented in nutritional practice, versus nutritional models. Discipline Nutrition in Practice Nutritional Model Physical X X Chemical X X Biological X X Social X Economic X Nutrition is life itself! If you've ever known an animal you truly loved, you might be thinking - an animal is more than just a nutritional system! This is true. Yet from the nutritionist's perspective, the biochemical processes of digestion and metabolism form the core of life itself. The animal's abilities to keep living, to grow, to move, to change, to reproduce, and to make milk are all outcomes of nutritional processes. 3.3 Systems concepts Let's start building our understanding of a single-animal nutritional system. A single animal nutritional system is centered on the body of one animal. However, the boundaries of the system are not the body of the animal per se, because our nutritional system includes both the animal's body and the digesta in the gastrointestinal tract. Collectively, we will call the body and digesta the animal. The animal is an open system--it interacts with its environment through inputs and outputs rather than being closed off to external forces. In our single animal nutritional system, the major inputs are the energy and nutrients in feed. Through the processes of digestion and metabolism, the inputs are transformed into various intermediates. Finally, the nutritional system has outputs such as milk, feces, urine, heat, and activity. Of course, the lives of animals unfold over time. Consequently, nutritional systems occur over time. This temporal aspect adds some complications for developing nutritional models. To simplify, we often assume that a nutritional system is in a steady state condition, or in other words, in dynamic equilibrium. A system in steady state has inputs flowing in, and outputs flowing out, without the state of the system itself changing. For example, a mature animal that is not lactating or growing may have relatively stable nutritional system. In contrast, systems can move through transient states where the system itself is undergoing changes. For example, as a young animal grows, their nutritional system is constantly transforming. Still, sometimes these transformations are small enough to ignore over a short period of time (e.g., the growth of a calf over 4 days). Because nutritional systems are dynamic, we almost always discuss their inputs, processes, and outputs in terms of rates (amounts per period of time) rather than amounts. However, as an additional simplification, we typically assume the denominator of the rate is one day in models such as NASEM. For example, we record the rate of dry matter intake (DMI, kg/d) and the rate of milk output (kg/d) in dairy nutritional trials. We can even model changes to the system itself one day at a time. For example, we can predict the nutrients required (amount per one day) for a calf to grow in body size (amount per one day). 3.4 Single-animal nutritional system A few guiding principles are true across nearly all animal nutritional models. These principles inform the basic structure of the nutritional model and are considered by researchers throughout the processes of model development. These rules are core assumptions in animal nutrition that we will see repeated throughout the NASEM model. 3.5 Physical/chemical principles: Mass &amp; energy balance Based on the laws of thermodynamics, we know that matter and energy are neither created nor destroyed. Because we know mass and energy will be conserved, we can start to develop rules about our single animal nutritional system. These very simple rules will help us represent the nutritional system in mathematical terms. At steady state, the flow (Q) of energy or mass into the system equals the flow out of the system: \\[ Q_{Input} = Q_{Output} \\] At a transient state, the flow of energy or mass into the system equals the flow out, plus the flow into transforming the system itself at a given point in time. Transformations can involve accumulation (positive) or decumulation (negative) of energy and matter into the system. \\[ Q_{Input} = Q_{Output} + Q_{Transformation} \\] The laws of thermodynamics are universal, so we can apply these rules to the flow of energy, or to the flow of any element (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) across the system. When applied to dairy cattle nutrition, input flows relate primarily to feed consumption. Elements and energy flow out of the animal in milk, feces, urine, and gas. Energy is transferred during movement and heat loss. Transformation flows occur when the animal's body grows, gains or loses tissues associated with reproduction, or gains or loses body reserves. Figure 3.2: Representation of animal nutrition as a system, showing examples for each category of flows Test yourself An animal was fed some feed containing 400 g/d of phosphorus (P). Later, the researcher analyzed the outputs (feces and urine) from the animal and recovered 350 g/d of P. Was this animal apparently at a steady state, or a transient state? How do you know? transient statesteady state For math appreciators If you are a math appreciator, you may notice some opportunities to use systems of differential equations to answer nutritional questions. 3.6 Biological principles: ordered processes Nutritional systems involve many different processes from macroscopic to microscopic scales. For any nutrient and for energy, nutritional models typically describe a core sequence of nutritional processes: Ingestion - the input of nutrients, energy, and water to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Digestion - the mechanical and chemical breakdown of larger molecules into smaller substances that can be absorbed (e.g., fatty acids, amino acids, glucose, ammonia). Absorption - the passage of molecules into the body itself (into circulation) rather than remaining in the gastrointestinal tract. Assimilation and Use - at the cellular level, the use of nutrients and energy in chemical reactions that sustain life and body functions. Associated with output and transformation processes. These nutritional processes can also be thought of as a set of rules. For example, a nutrient or energy must be ingested before it can be digested, absorbed, assimilated, or used. Therefore, we know that the gross amount ingested is always greater than the amount digested. The amount digested is greater than the amount available for metabolism. Finally, the amount available for metabolism is greater than the net amount used in output and transformation processes. When energy and nutrients are mobilized from body reserves, they have already passed through the processes of ingestion, digestion, and absorption. Similarly, in nutrition trials where small-molecules are infused into the bloodstream or distal gastrointestinal tract, these nutrients \"skip ahead\" of ingestion and digestion. 3.7 Biological principles: context-dependence The laws of thermodynamics and other physical/chemical rules are fairly universal--they hold true across many contexts. The same core processes of nutrition can be found across the Animalia kingdom. This gives us the basic configuration of a nutritional system that will be true across different types of animals. But beyond this, the structure and behavior of nutritional systems is dependent on the context. For example, imagine the nutritional system of a lactating, high-producing Holstein fed a high-quality ration, versus that of a dry heifer fed a diet based on poor-quality forage. The principles of mass balance and the order of nutritional processes apply to both. Yet, we expect the specific behavior of the nutritional system will be vary between these two contexts. Therefore, our final guiding principle states that the structure and behavior of nutritional systems is context-dependent. Elements of the context such as breed, genetics, production system, geographic region, etc., determine how the system functions. Sometimes, aspects of the context can be represented in nutritional models, as we will see in the NASEM model. 3.8 Conclusions With these guiding principles, we can sketch out a rough outline of the configuration of a single-animal nutritional system for any nutrient or for energy. We know that our system will have inputs, outputs, and the potential to transform itself. We know that the system functions through core nutritional processes from ingestion to assimilation and use. We know that the specifics of the system behavior depend on contextual factors. Figure 3.3: Representation of animal nutrition as a system, showing the overarching effects of contextual factors Although we have made progress in establishing the basic configuration of a nutritional system, we want to be able to answer practical questions! For example: Does this diet supply enough minerals to support the growth and development of a 3-month old calf? How much dietary protein will it take to support the process of uterine involution in a postpartum cow? For an animal walking 1000 meters to the parlor each day, how much extra energy is required? These questions require us to characterize the system in greater detail. In the subsequent chapters, we will discuss nutritional inputs, processes, and outputs in much greater detail. We will delineate which contextual factors have the greatest impact on nutritional system behavior. By the end, you will be able to use a nutritional model (NASEM) to predict how inputs will be split up into specific outputs (e.g., what amount of nutrient X will appear in milk, urine, feces) or used in system transformation. Test yourself Think about the illustration below showing how marbles flow through a series of blocks. Can you draw an analogy to mass balance? A) Discuss input, output, and transformation (accumulation) in terms of marbles flowing in and out of this system. B) In this system, what happens during steady state, and transient state conditions? In this system, all the marbles enter the same way. What determines where the marbles leave the system (which color tunnel) or where they get stuck in the system? If you're losing your marbles, you can click below to see one interpretation of this marble sorter as a system. Show an explanation Marbles are input at the top of the system and output at the bottom when they leave the blocks. A system transformation occurs when a marble gets stuck somewhere in the system, because it changes the form of the system and its reaction to new inputs. Steady state conditions would involve inputs equalling the outputs. In other words, the number of marbles in would equal the number of marbles out for a given period of time. Transient state conditions would involve the accumulation or decumulation of marbles, where the flow of inputs would not equal the flow of outputs. In this system, the fates of marbles are determined by what blocks they run into, and possibly other factors such as the weight and size of the marble. 3.9 Questions Describe the core physical/chemical principles underlying nutritional models. List and describe the core sequence of ordered processes in nutrition. What is an open system, and how does it apply to animal nutrition?

Learning Objectives Define a nutrient requirement in precise terms. Explain how nutrient requirements are determined through experimentation. List and discuss limitations of typical conceptions of “requirement” 4.1 Defining nutrient flows 4.1.1 Supplies, requirements, and balances As we read earlier, nutritional models can be used for many different purposes. However, the core of a model like NASEM is its ability to predict two sets of parameters: supplies and requirements. In order to design diets that support the animal's needs for a healthy, productive life, the nutritionist needs to know both sides: the amount of nutrients that the diet supplies, and also the amount that is required by the animal given its physiological state and production characteristics. Having information about both supplies and requirements allows a nutritionist to evaluate the adequacy of a diet with respect to the animal needs. For a given nutrient (or for energy), the difference between the amount supplied and the amount required is referred to as the balance. Nutritional models typically consider nutrients that are most relevant to the animal's functioning. This includes nutrients present in both large and small quantities: Macronutrients are required in large amounts, and typically present in large amounts in feeds. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are macronutrients. Micronutrients are required in comparatively smaller amounts, yet deficiencies (even of a few grams!) can be catastrophic to the animal's functioning. Micronutrients include vitamins and minerals. In this chapter, we will get very specific about what is meant by the term \"requirement.\" We will see some of the difficulties involved in formulating a diet that meets the needs of an entire group of animals, rather than a single animal. Additionally, we will discuss nutritional concepts and dietary reference intakes that help nutritionists protect against over- and underfeeding, each of which can have harmful effects. Is energy a nutrient? Energy is not a nutrient per se. Instead, energy is a physical property that refers to the capacity to do work. Energy is derived from macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fat). Animals require sufficient energy to maintain body functioning and performance, so energy supply and requirements are included in most nutritional models, including NASEM. 4.1.2 Requirement definitions in human and dairy nutrition Previous editions of “Nutrient Requirements for Dairy Cattle” did not explicitly define the term nutrient requirement, but NASEM includes an entire chapter delineating nutrient requirements and related terms. Much of this work is based on definitions used in human nutrition. NASEM's Food and Nutrition Board in the Institute of Medicine (2006) defined a series of terms outlining what nutrient requirement means in the human nutrition context. The dairy nutrition committee selected from these terms for use with dairy cattle. The NASEM book defines a nutrient requirement as “the daily amount of a nutrient necessary to meet a healthy animal’s needs for maintenance, activity, growth, reproduction, and lactation without any changes in body reserves or status” (NASEM, 2021, p. 4). Let's break down each part of this definition. the daily amount of a nutrient - In human and animal nutrition, nutrient requirements are often given in amounts per day. Thus, a requirement is a rate of amount consumed per unit time. The use of “day” as the denominator is practical. Per hour is too short a timescale, because animals do not require nutrients every hour to maintain their health and functioning. Yet per week is too long, because an animal deprived of a certain nutrient would probably show symptoms associated with that nutrient deficiency. Additionally, most cattle rations are mixed and fed once or twice daily, so farm operators need to know the amounts to feed once or twice daily. Therefore, amount per day is a logical choice of timescale for expressing the requirements of most nutrients. a healthy animal's needs - NASEM acknowledges that illnesses alter the physiological state of animals such that they have different nutrition requirements. However, each illness alters nutrient requirements differently. The committee decided that there was insufficient data to predict requirements for unhealthy animals presently. As such, requirements are based on the assumption that the animal is healthy. for maintenance, activity, growth, reproduction, and lactation without any changes in body reserves or status - This part explains that nutrient requirements are calculated to allow the animal to maintain various body functions without gaining or losing body reserves (e.g., losing fat or muscle mass) or status (e.g., losing milk production). Therefore, a nutrient requirement is specific to a given animal and scenario. Think to Yourself: How is the term nutrient requirement used colloquially, and how does this differ from its scientific definition? 4.1.3 Absorbed and metabolizable amounts Before moving on, we need to add more detail to what is meant by the daily amount of a nutrient. We know that not all the energy and nutrients eaten by an animal can be actually used for the body functions listed above. This is because a fraction of the energy and nutrients is excreted in feces and urine, and another fraction is lost as gas and heat. When discussing requirements, NASEM most often gives the amount of nutrient on a metabolizable basis. This means that when we define the daily amount of a nutrient required, we mean the amount that is actually available for the animal to use for body functions (metabolizable amount) rather than the total amount of intake (gross amount). This will be detailed in later chapters. Reporting requirements as metabolizable amounts applies to energy and most nutrients except minerals, which are considered on an absorbed basis. The committee most likely chose an absorbed basis for minerals due to data availability. Many mineral studies report the amount of circulating minerals in the blood (absorbed) and few studies analyze mineral content in excreta (feces and urine). Just for fun: Check a human food label. Similar to reporting for dairy cattle nutrition, human nutrition labels typically show the amounts of metabolizable energy and nutrients. 4.2 Dietary reference intakes We established a basic definition for a nutrient requirement. Estimating these average requirements is an important component of NASEM (2021). But NASEM Dairy-8 not only helps determine the daily amount of nutrient required on average (the mean), it also gives information about the variability around the average (the variance). As a consequence, the estimated average requirement is just one parameter in a class of terms referred to as dietary reference intakes. These dietary reference intakes combine information about both the mean and variance in a requirement to assist nutritionists in formulating rations that protect against under- and over-supplying nutrients. Dietary Reference Intakes include the estimated average requirement, the recommended daily allowance, adequate intake, and maximum tolerable level. Each of these will be defined in the subsequent sections. The dietary reference intakes are based on the principle that nutrient requirements are not a single fixed level of nutrient intake. Instead, nutrient requirements have both a mean and variance. In other words, a distribution. NASEM explains that within a given group of animals at a particular life stage, the distribution of responses to nutrient intake includes predictable and unpredictable variation. Predictable sources of variation are factors with a known effect on the animal's response to nutrient intake (e.g., stage of lactation, milk production, body weight). Conversely, unpredictable variation represents both random variation and unmeasured variation. 4.2.1 Protecting against underfeeding with \"safety factors\" Considering the variance in nutrient requirements is especially important when it comes to avoiding reductions in performance due to nutrient deficiencies. For example, let's imagine we have a population of lactating cows with a distribution of requirements that looks as shown below. We feed them the estimated average requirement (EAR), as shown with the vertical red line: Figure 4.2: Population distribution of nutrient requirements with reference intakes annotated. Test Yourself: What proportion of the population is being underfed if nutrient intake is at the EAR? When feeding the average requirement, we can see that about half the animals will be overfed, and half will be underfed the nutrient. Underfeeding nutrients is expected to worsen health and performance. For this reason, human and animal nutritionists often feed not the average requirement, but instead the average requirement plus a \"safety factor.\" In order to determine an appropriate safety factor, we need to know the variance in the requirement. For example, in human nutrition, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) refers to the EAR + two standard deviations (recall that standard deviation is a measure of variance). Figure 4.3: Population distribution of nutrient requirements with reference intakes annotated. Test Yourself: What proportion of the population is being underfed if nutrient intake is at the RDA (EAR + 2 standard deviations)? click here for an answer Because the RDA is set at 2 standard deviations above the EAR, when feeding at the RDA, only a small proportion (2-3%) of the population is being underfed. The majority (97-98%) of the population is being fed an adequate amount. This illustrates how nutritionists need to know both the mean and variance of a nutrient requirement to make informed decisions about the amount to feed. 4.2.2 Protecting against overfeeding For dairy cattle, it is often preferable to overfeed nutrients than to underfeed. However, there are risks associated with overfeeding that nutritionists must guard against. For example, overfeeding energy could result in excessive body reserve gain leading to an increased risk of ketosis. Overfeeding the mineral selenium can cause acute toxicosis. Overfeeding crude protein is associated with reduced reproductive performance and an increase in negative environmental impacts. In cases where toxicities have been observed and adequate data are available, NASEM provides the maximum tolerable level (MTL) of a nutrient. At the MTL, research has shown that symptoms of toxicity begin to occur. Vary in requirement. Keeping in mind that feeds vary in composition and animals vary in their requirements, nutritionists should aim to create rations that are sufficiently below the MTL to reduce the chances of toxicities. Test yourself The maximum tolerable level is the amount of nutrient that would kill an average animal. TRUEFALSE 4.2.3 Accounting for uncertainty Finally, NASEM acknowledged that there are certain cases where insufficient data are available to determine the mean and variance for a nutrient requirement. In these cases, the committee makes an educated guess on an appropriate level for the nutrient requirement. The best guess for the requirement is referred to not as an EAR, but instead as an adequate intake (AI). This distinction helps nutritionists determine whether the requirement has been determined after substantial experimental studies (EAR) or whether the requirement is an educated guess by the committee (AI). Putting it all together, we can see all of the dietary reference intakes discussed so far: Figure 4.4: Population distribution of nutrient requirements with reference intakes annotated. Think to Yourself: The figure shows several reference intake levels. What does each mean, and when might it be useful? 4.3 NASEM estimates of requirements To estimate nutrient requirements, NASEM calculates separate requirements for each different body functions: including requirements for maintenance, activity, growth, reproduction, lactation, and changes in body reserves. Summing these requirements gives the total requirement for each nutrition. This method for calculating requirements is referred to as a factorial approach because it sums the contributions of different factors to determine the total requirement. As an example, the net protein recommended for an animal equals the sum of its separate net protein requirements for maintenance, activity, growth, reproduction, and changes in body reserves. \\[ NP_{total} = NP_{maintenance} + NP_{activity} + NP_{growth}+ NP_{reproduction} + NP_{bodyreserve} \\] Test yourself The factorial approach refers to summing across multiple factors. TRUEFALSE 4.4 Types of literature used by NASEM (2021) We know now that a nutrient requirement is the daily (metabolizable or absorbed) amount of a nutrient required to support an animal's body functioning without changing body reserves and status. We also know that requirements are often calculated factorially, e.g., separate requirements are estimated for maintenance, gestation, lactation, growth, and reserve gain and summed together to estimate the total nutrient requirement. Yet how does NASEM (2021) determine the required nutrient needed for separate body functions? The committee uses a variety of types of research. The narrative in NASEM (2021) focuses on research done after the 7th edition (NRC, 2001), but it also cites some classical studies done in prior years. Some examples of the types of literature referenced by NASEM are discussed below. 4.4.1 Measuring composition of inputs, body tissues, and outputs Nutrient requirements for growth and changes in body reserves are often estimated using data on body composition. For example, early researchers determined the chemical composition of the carcasses of animals slaughtered at different ages. They assumed that 1 kg of growth in the body frame (carcass) would require at least as many nutrients as were contained in 1 kg of the body frame at slaughter. Similarly, studies have measured the composition of cows with more or less body reserve (body reserves = primarily adipose and muscle tissue). This type of research is often used to calculate nutrient requirements expected for certain rates (kg/d) of growth and changes in body reserves. Researchers in the mid-20th century studied the chemical composition of the gravid (pregnant) uterus, including the fetus, placenta, and the uterus itself. They tracked the growth of the gravid uterus across the gestation period. This type of research helped determined nutrient requirements for gestation, often based on the gestational age (days pregnant) and the expected weight of the calf. 4.4.2 Measuring losses when intake is minimal To determine maintenance requirements, one experimental approach involves feeding animals very little of the nutrient in question for a short period. Then, researchers can determine the amount of nutrient that would be lost (in urine and feces) through body functions alone (not diet). For example, part of the maintenance requirement for protein is the amount of protein lost in feces due to typical gastrointestinal tract secretions and sloughed cells. This fraction is referred to as metabolic fecal protein. Typically, the protein in feces includes both metabolic fecal protein and undigested dietary protein. When minimal protein is fed, the amount of undigested dietary protein approaches zero. This isolates the amount of metabolic protein needed by the animal. A similar approach is used to determine the energy, protein, and minerals lost in urine as part of maintenance body functions (Swanson, 1977). 4.4.3 Studying symptoms of deficiency and toxicity The NASEM (2021) committee also used studies that reported observable symptoms of deficiency and toxicity. For example, vitamin D deficiency (rickets) is known to cause a stiff gait, bowed legs, and increased incidence of fractures. By studying the levels of absorbed vitamin D that were associated with visible symptoms, the committee could establish minimum nutrient requirements. Conversely, the committee set upper limits by examining the level of nutrient associated with symptoms of toxicity. This approach was particularly important with vitamin and mineral requirements. 4.4.4 Regression on productive performance Finally, the NASEM (2021) committee cited several works where requirements was studied with a regression approach. When data are abundant, regression enables researchers to mathematically relate values of a nutrient (X) to an animal performance trait (Y). For example, milk and milk component data are often used as dependent (Y) variables in regression. This is because nearly every study with dairy cattle measures the production of milk and components. For many people, regression calls to mind the image of a line. Perhaps in high school, they learned that a line can describe the relationship between X and Y variables by an intercept and slope. The regressions cited by NASEM (2021) uses a similar idea. However, the relationship between the metabolizable amount of a nutrient (X) and animal performance (Y) is generally not expected to be a single line. Two common shapes are given below. 4.4.4.1 Breakpoint analysis or \"broken-stick\" response Assuming the same animal and diet characteristics, one way researchers have conceptualized requirements is through breakpoint analysis (Robbins, 2006). With this framework in mind, researchers examine the performance response (e.g., the production of fat- and protein-corrected milk, FPCM) with increasing metabolizable amounts of nutrient X. The requirement is expected to be the \"breakpoint\" where additional amounts of nutrient (X) lead to zero gains in performance (Y). Breakpoint analysis is sometimes referred to as a \"broken-stick\" model, because it resemble a stick of wood that has been snapped. More technically, it is a piecewise linear function. The breakpoint or broken-stick model supposes the following: Feeding more nutrient X will increase FPCM production if nutrient X is deficient. Feeding above the requirement for nutrient X will result in no gains in FPCM (response = 0). Figure 4.5: Broken-stick response to nutrient X metaboliazble amounts 4.4.4.2 Curvlinear response Sometimes, the broken-stick type response does not match well with the observed data (Pesti et al., 2009). This can be because excessive amounts of the nutrient X lead to declines in performance Y, rather than Y remaining flat. Or perhaps the relation between X and Y may appear to be made up of curves rather than lines. In these cases, we can express the relation of X and Y using mathematical terms for curves. For example, polynomial functions, e.g., \\(FPCM = 25 + 12x -0.1x^2\\) can describe a gradual increase in performance that curves to reach a maximum and declines. A logistic function can describe a situation where additional metabolizable amounts of nutrient X result in smaller and smaller gains in performance (Y). Various mathematical functions are used \"behind the scenes\" in the NASEM (2021) nutritional model, and they are based on regression work. In general, nutrient requirements are determined by experiments where different levels of a nutrient are fed and animals' responses (e.g., bodyweight, milk production, reproductive performance) are observed. Let's consider a hypothetical nutrient X. A single experiment might compare just a few levels of nutrient X and record the average response. For example, researchers could feed 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5% of diet dry matter as calcium and record the response with each level. Over time, more experiments are done. The data from multiple experiments can be combined through meta-analysis. Compared to an experiment that shows responses to just a few levels of nutrient X metabolizable amounts, a meta-analysis can show animal responses across a large range of nutrient X metabolizable amounts. Using data from the meta-analysis, researchers can plot animal performance at each level of nutrient X intake to determine the nutrient requirement for a given scenario. Test Yourself: Assume you have the data to plot the volume of milk production (Y) at different levels of the metabolizable amount of nutrient X. How would you determine the required amount of nutrient X for each level of milk production?

Use basic math to solve nutritional problems such as converting units, converting basis, scaling, and weighting. Use a predictive model, in software, to generate estimates. Discuss some of the types of predictive models used in dairy nutrition work. Set up and solve a diet optimization problem. In the last chapter, we learned about some of the core parameters in the NASEM model: supplies and requirements. In this chapter, we will roll up our sleeves and look under the hood of the NASEM model to learn more about other types of parameters beyond supplies and requirements. We will also discuss some of the core mathematical concepts that underlie the NASEM model functioning. The chapter is titled \"Model machinery\" because it discusses some of the fundamental math that makes the NASEM model work. Nutrition involves primarily practical mathematical and statistical problems. Animal nutritionists use nutritional modeling software to do the \"heavy lifting\" for many types of calculations. We will consider three categories of math and statistics that are used often by nutritionists, as these also form the basis of many nutritional models. Basic mathematics Predictive models Optimization 5.1 Basic nutrition math Under the hood, some parts of the NASEM model are basic operations such as converting units, converting the basis, and scaling quantities. These operations are based on general facts, so they are unlikely to change with future updates to the model. For example, 1 kg will always equal 1000 g. 5.1.1 Using ratios, percentages, proportions Some of the most frequent math problems done by nutritional scientists are quite simple. To get started, we just need to review some elementary math. The definitions may seem quite simple, but they can lead to huge errors if done incorrectly! Relating any two quantities: Ratios relate any two quantities with different units, or the same units. Ratios can be expressed as a fraction or as a numeral. In either case, the ratio must be expressed with units. Relating parts of a whole: Percentages are often used to relate two quantities with the same units and expressed as a number between 0 and 100. Proportions convey the same information as a percentage, except they are expressed as a fraction of 1. Percentages and proportions can sometimes get confusing if there are no units. This is why it can be helpful to explicitly state the units rather than using the % sign. For example, the fat content of milk (e.g., 3.7%) could be expressed equivalently as the kg of fat per 100 kg of milk (\\(\\frac{3.7 \\space kg \\space fat}{100 \\space kg \\space milk}\\)). The word \"percent\" literally translates to \"per 100\"! As a proportion, we could write \\(\\frac{0.037 \\text{ kg milk fat }}{\\text{1 kg milk}}\\). Next time you hear a percent or proportion, ask yourself... 1) what are the numerator and denominator? 2) What are the units? Test Yourself: True or false: ratios can be expressed without units. TRUEFALSE How are percentages expressed? As a fractionAs a dividendAs a number between 0 and 100 True or false: ratios can be used to relate quantities with the same units? TRUEFALSE 5.1.2 Converting units In the field, many animal producers in the U.S. use units based on both the Imperial system (e.g., lbs, inches) and the metric system (e.g., grams, meters). However, most research in animal nutrition is published using the metric system. The metric system is somewhat simpler, in that the prefixes of a unit represents its order of magnitude relative to the base unit (e.g., a gram). Most quantities that apply for single animal nutritional models range from the milligram to kilogram range. Nutritionists work with a variety of input data, and they often need to convert units from smaller amounts (e.g., the animal level) to larger amounts (e.g., the farm level). Order of Magnitude Prefix Unit Value pico p 10^-12 nano n 10^-9 micro µ 10^-6 milli m 10^-3 centi c 10^-2 deci d 10^-1 deca da 10^1 hecto h 10^2 kilo k 10^3 mega M 10^6 giga G 10^9 Test yourself: Metric practice What is the mass in kg of 50 lbs feed? Use one decimals. kg A bull has a mass of 900 kg. How many pounds does the bull weigh? Report the whole number with no decimals. lbs. If a vet prescribes 1.5 g of a medication, and each tablet contains 125 mg, how many tablets should be given? tablets Show explanations 50 lbs * (1 kg/ 2.2 lb) = 22.68 kg 900 * 2.2 = 1980 1,500 mg * (1 tablet / 125 mg) = 12 tablets 5.1.3 Converting basis In animal nutrition, almost everything from feed to animal tissues contains water. The water content can vary substantially. Although water is important in nutrition, nutritionists generally do calculations on a dry matter basis. This means that quantities are expressed as a fraction of the non-water (dry matter) content, rather than as a fraction of the total. Feed as-is and dry matter contents, illustrating how a fraction C can be thought of on a different basis. For a nutrient called C, the proportion of C on an as-is basis is calculated as the mass of C divided by the total mass including wet and dry matter. \\[ \\text{As-is basis }= \\frac{\\text{mass of C}}{\\text{total mass of water and dry matter}} \\] To calculate the proportion of C on a DM basis, we divide the mass of C by the mass of DM, ignoring the wet matter. \\[ \\text{DM basis }= \\frac{\\text{mass of C}}{\\text{ mass of dry matter }} \\] Most of the NASEM predictions are done on a dry matter basis. This means that quantities are expressed in relation to the dry matter content of a feed (as fractions of the dry matter content). For some feeds, it makes an enormous difference whether nutrient composition is expressed on a DM basis vs. as-is basis (e.g., corn silage, grass silage). For other feeds, it makes no difference at all (e.g., limestone, iron oxide) because the feed contains very minimal water. To convert nutrient content from an as-is basis to a DM basis, we need to know: The DM content of the feed The nutrient content of the feed It can help to write down everything you know, including units. \\[15 \\text{ %CP, as-is basis} = \\frac{\\text{15 kg feed CP}}{\\text{100 kg feed as-is}} \\\\[16pt] 50\\text{% DM as-is basis} = \\frac{50 \\text{ kg feed DM}}{100\\text{ kg feed DM}}\\] To convert to a DM basis, we need to think about our desired units: kg CP / kg DM. Thinking backwards, we can use the other information we have (the DM content of the feed). Ratios are useful, because we can invert them (flip them) whichever way we need, as long as we keep track of the units. \\[\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\text{15 kg feed CP}}{\\text{100 kg feed as-is}} * \\frac{\\text{100 kg feed as-is}}{\\text{50 kg feed DM}} &amp;=\\\\[6pt] \\frac{15 \\text{ kg feed CP}}{50 \\text{kg feed DM}}&amp; = \\\\[6pt] \\frac{30 \\text{ kg feed CP}}{100 \\text{ kg feed DM}} &amp;= 30 \\text{% CP on a DM basis} \\end{aligned}\\] To go in the reverse direction, we can convert back to an as-is basis. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\text{30 kg feed CP}}{\\text{100 kg feed DM}} * \\frac{\\text{50 kg feed DM}}{\\text{100 kg feed as-is}} &amp;=\\\\[6pt] \\frac{30 * 50 \\text{ kg feed CP}}{100*100 \\text{ kg feed as-is} } &amp;= \\\\[6pt] \\frac{0.15 \\text{ kg feed CP}} {1 \\text{ kg feed as-is}} = \\frac{15 \\text{ kg feed CP}} {100 \\text{ kg feed as-is}} &amp;= 15 \\text{ % CP as-is}\\\\[6pt] \\end{aligned} \\] Here's the kicker - the dry matter basis is not the only basis used in nutrition. Sometimes nutrient content is expressed in relation to other quantities. For example, in field work, nutritionists sometimes refer to the rumen-degradable and rumen-undegradable fractions of crude protein. Therefore, these fractions are not expressed per 100 units of feed dry matter, they are expressed per 100 units of feed CP. Nutrient digestibility is typically given as a percentage of that particular nutrient intake (e.g., fiber digestibility as a percentage of fiber intake). Therefore, it is critical to keep track of the units in the numerator and denominator when doing any sort of nutrition calculations to prevent errors. Test yourself Assuming the feed contains water, the amount of a nutrient on a DM basis is less thangreater than the amount on an as-is basis. Test yourself A nutritionist is given the crude protein (CP) content of a feed on an as-is basis. CP% as-is = 8% Because most nutritional calculations are done on a DM basis, they want to convert this value to a DM basis. What other information do they need? amount of feed in rationdry matter content of the feedweight of the feed Try to do the conversion of the as-is to DM basis yourself, assuming the DM content of the feed is 35%. click here for the answer CP % as-is = 8% DM content of the feed = 35% (8% ) * (100 / 35) = 22.8% CP on a DM basis Additional literature For some extra practice and visualizations of DM and as-is basis calculations, check out this resource by Reiling (2022) and the University of Nebraska Extension: https://extensionpublications.unl.edu/assets/html/g2093/build/g2093.htm 5.1.4 Scaling Scaling involves multiplying every element of a vector or matrix by the same, single number. Incidentally, this is why one single number is sometimes referred to as a \"scalar.\" Often, operations in the NASEM model simply involve scaling chemical composition (e.g., the percentages of each chemical in a feed or body pool) to amounts. For example, we can scale the diet composition by the DMI to determine the amount of intake of each nutrient. \\[{kg \\space DMI \\space* \\begin{bmatrix} \\text{% ADF in diet}\\\\ \\text{% NDF in diet} \\\\ \\text{% CP in diet} \\\\ \\text{% Fat in diet} \\\\ \\text{% Ash in diet} \\end{bmatrix} /100 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\text{kg ADF intake}\\\\ \\text{kg NDF intake} \\\\ \\text{kg CP intake} \\\\ \\text{kg Fat intake} \\\\ \\text{kg Ash intake} \\end{bmatrix}}\\] Scaling milk composition to amounts Producers typically have information about the fat, protein, and lactose composition of milk (%) and the mass of milk produced (kg or lb). By scaling the composition using the total amount, we can calculate the amounts of fat, protein, and lactose production. Given the following information: Fat = 3.85% True protein = 3.10% Lactose = 4.65% Milk production = 36 kg Calculate the amounts of fat, true protein, and lactose produced. Click here for an answer The problem can be set up as follows: $${ kg Milk production \\[\\begin{bmatrix} \\text{% Fat in milk} \\\\ \\text{% True protein in milk}\\\\ \\text{% Lactose in milk} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\] /100 = \\[\\begin{bmatrix} \\text{kg Fat production} \\\\ \\text{kg True protein production}\\\\ \\text{kg Lactose production} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\] }$$ Using this formula, we would calculate as follows: 36 * 3.85 / 100 = 1.386 kg fat 36 * 3.10 / 100 = 1.116 kg true protein 36 * 4.65 / 100 = 1.674 kg lactose 5.1.5 Weighting Weighting involves multiplying each element of a set of values with its corresponding element in a set of weights. Weighted sums and weighted means are common in animal nutrition. For example, weighted means are used to calculate diet composition from ingredient composition and ingredient inclusion rates. A weighted sum is the sum of the products of a set of values (\\(x\\)) and weights (\\(w\\)). \\[ \\text{Weighted sum}= \\sum_{i = 1}^{n \\space feeds} w_ix_i \\] \\(x_i\\) is the value to be weighted (e.g., nutrient composition of feed \\(i\\)) \\(w_i\\) is the weight (e.g., the inclusion rate of feed \\(i\\)) To calculate a weighted mean, we divide the weighted sum (the numerator) by the sum of the weights. \\[ \\text{Weighted mean}= \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} w_ix_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i} \\] where \\(x_i\\) is the \\(i\\)th value, and \\(w_i\\) is the weight corresponding to \\(x_i\\). If the weights are expressed as proportions (out of 1), the weighted mean and weighted sum are equivalent because the denominator is 1. If the weights are expressed as percentages (out of 100), or some other way, the denominator is more important. As an example, for a given diet, we could multiply the fat content of each feed by the inclusion rate of each feed (as a proportion). Then, we would sum up all of the values to get the fat content of the diet. Calculating diet fat content with a weighted mean A diet includes 45% corn silage, 20% alfalfa silage and 35% concentrate mix (inclusion rates). The fat content of these feeds are: Corn silage, fat = 2.5% of DM Alfalfa silage, fat = 2.0% of DM Concentrate mix, fat = 9.0% of DM. What is the fat content of the diet? click here for a worked example Calculate each (\\(w_i x_i\\)) for the n = 3 feeds. 0.45 * 2.5 = 1.125 0.20 * 2.0 = 0.40 0.35 * 9.0 = 3.15 Sum the \\(w_i x_i\\) for the n = 3 feeds. 1.125 + 0.40 + 3.15 = 4.675 5.2 Predictive models Another set of mathematical operations in nutrition stems from predictive models. Predictive models are equations that stem from statistical analysis of nutritional data through techniques such as regression. Each equation embodies the relationships among dependent (Y) and independent (X) variables. Using a predictive model is simple...plug known values (Xs) into the equation to solve for the unknown (Y) variable. When new data become available, nutritionists will often want to update the predictive models. As a result, the sections of nutritional models that have been developed through statistical analysis are continually changing. 5.2.1 Predictive model descriptors Empirical vs. theoretical Empirical and theoretical are two ends of a spectrum used to describe models. These terms refer to the way in which a model was developed. When a model is more empirical, it is typically based on observed data and simple relationships. The word \"empirical\" means that it is based on experience. Conversely, theoretical models are more based on logic and abstract ideas, rather than observations in practice. Input-output vs. mechanistic Some models are concerned only with observed inputs and outputs. Their structure is something like INPUT -&gt; Black Box -&gt; OUTPUT, meaning that the mechanisms between input and output are not well-characterized. These models are often more empirical rather than theoretical. Conversely, when a model is more mechanistic, it depicts the processes and intermediates in great detail. Mechanistic models can be thought of as INPUT -&gt; Detailed Process -&gt; OUTPUT models. Mechanistic models often involve more theory. These terms are used in the NASEM narrative and more broadly to describe the types of predictive models. Most predictive models are some combination of the terms above. In other words, models fall somewhere on a spectrum rather than splitting into discrete categories. Test yourself A (An) input-outputmechanistic model represents processes in great detail. An empiricalimperial model is based on observed relationships. 5.2.2 Simple linear model (empirical, input-output) As an example, we previously used a predictive model: \\(DMI \\space (kg) = 0.03 * BW\\). To use it, we plugged in known values to the right-hand side (independent variables). \\(DMI\\) = ? \\(0.03\\) a coefficient relating DMI and BW determined in past research \\(BW\\) = 702 \\(DMI = 0.03*702\\) \\(DMI = 21.06 kg\\) This model is more empirical, because it is based on observations. It is more input-output, because it does not represent any of the reasons or mechanisms behind why greater BW could lead to greater DMI. 5.2.3 Exponential growth kinetic model (theoretical, mechanistic) Think to yourself If you raised a newborn calf to its mature weight, and weighed it every day, what would it look like to plot its weight (Y) over time (X)? How would its growth rate (mass/time) change as it got larger? The rate:state equation tells us the growth rate. The growth rate is expressed here as the difference in mass (\\(dM\\)) per the difference in time (\\(dt\\)). This is referred to as first order kinetics, because the mass (\\(M\\)) is multiplied by a scalar \\(a^1 = a\\). \\[ \\frac{dM}{dt} = a M \\] where \\(a\\) is the growth constant. This equation suggests that as the mass grows, the \"growth machinery\" also grows. In other words, an animal that weighs 50 lbs might grow 0.5 lbs per day, but an animal at 500 lbs would grow at a faster rate (5 lbs per day) proportional to its mass. Integrating the rate:state equation (finding the area underneath it) allows us to find the mass at any point in time. We find the definite integral from the start of the process \\(t = 0\\) to another point in time \\(t = t_1\\). The integral tells us that the mass at a given time \\(M\\) is equal to the initial mass \\(M_0\\) times the exponential of \\(at\\), the growth constant multiplied by time. \\[ M = M_0e^{at} \\] Functions similar to this integrated rate law appear in the NASEM model to predict the growth rate of the fetus during gestation. Importantly, the function is cut off after the time of calving (otherwise, the mass would continue to increase!). Test yourself First order kinetics means that the mass grows at a constant rate. TRUEFALSE The exponential function (integrated rate equation) shown above would slow down after enough time had passed. TRUEFALSE Literature deep dive France et al. (1996) described growth rates in animal science. France, J., Dijkstra, J., &amp; Dhanoa, M. S. (1996). Growth functions and their application in animal science. In Annales de zootechnie (Vol. 45, No. Suppl1, pp. 165-174). 5.2.4 Saturable growth kinetics (theoretical, mechanistic) The Michaelis-Menten model describes a saturable growth process. A function is saturable when it reaches an upper or lower bound rather than continuing infinitely. This form of growth is used in NASEM to model microbial protein synthesis. The Michaelis-Menten equation uses the term velocity, which is a general term encompassing the changes in products \\(\\frac{d[P]}{dt}\\) and substrates \\(\\frac{d[S]}{dt}\\) over time. \\[v = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}\\] where \\(V\\) is the growth rate \\(S\\) is the substrate concentration \\(V_{max}\\) is the maximum velocity (max. reaction rate) and \\(V_{max}/2\\) is half the maximum velocity. The velocity is \\(V_{max}/2\\) when \\(K_m = [S]\\). \\(K_m\\) is the Michaelis constant, which is the concentration of substrate when the reaction velocity is 50% of the \\(V_{max}\\) At low concentrations the velocity is proportional to the concentration of substrate \\(S\\). One way to think of this is that \\(K_m\\) is larger than \\([S]\\), so \\(K_m + [S] \\approx K_m\\), so the velocity is affected by the ratio of \\(\\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\) times the maximum velocity. This is similar to first-order kinetics, where the growth rate (velocity) is a linear function of the growth machinery (e.g., the substrate concentration). At this point, the growth is not saturated. At high concentrations of substrate \\(S\\), the rate approaches a maximum velocity. This is because \\([S]\\) has become larger than \\(K_m\\), and \\(K_m + [S] \\approx [S]\\). The rate is \\(\\frac{[S]}{[S]}\\) times the maximum velocity ($ * V_{max}$. This is more similar to zeroth-order kinetics, because the growth rate is constant. The growth process becomes saturated as it gets closer and closer to \\(V_{max}\\). Feeling confused? Click below for a more practical example. 🍞 Tell me an analogy on saturable growth Imagine you owned a bakery of a certain size with 13 dedicated bakers (a baker's dozen! 👩‍🍳). You are in charge of providing the bakers ingredients (substrates). At first you give them no ingredients. The bakers make no bread, and sit around the bakery all day. Then, you decide to start giving them a small amount of ingredients every day. They are very excited and make as much bread as they can using the ingredients. At the end of the day, they still have some time to relax. The bakers send you a note - \"We would be happy to make more bread if you give us more ingredients.\" You increase the amount of ingredients provided per day. The bakers are still very excited, and they make even more bread than ever before. They have less time to relax. At this stage, you start to think that the amount of bread made is proportional to the amount of ingredients provided. This is great news, you think, because if you simply provide more ingredients to the bakers, everyone will get more bread. You tell the bakers - it's time to push it to the limit. You offer them thousands of pounds of ingredients to use as fast as they can. The bakers spend all day making as much bread as they can, but at the end of the day there are still ingredients leftover. They can't seem to catch up! You keep giving them more ingredients, expecting more bread. The bakers work as fast as they can. In desperation, the bakers finally send you an angry note - \"There is a limit to how fast we can make bread!!!\" 5.2.5 DMI prediction in NASEM Let's take a look at an actual predictive models in NASEM. For example, an equation for predicting DMI in NASEM (p. 12, eq. 2-1) uses parity, BW, body condition score (BCS), day in lactation, and milk net energy production. Researchers observed 3,143 lactations where roughly half the observations represented primiparous cows and half were from multiparous cows. After testing different equations, they found one that provided a good fit with the data: \\[\\begin{aligned} DMI (kg/d) &amp;= [3.7 + (5.7*Parity) + \\\\ &amp;\\quad (0.305*MilkE) + \\\\ &amp;\\quad (0.022*BW) + \\\\ &amp;\\quad (-0.689-1.87*Parity)*BCS]*\\\\ &amp;\\quad [1-(0.212+0.136*Parity)*e^{(-0.053*DIM)}] \\end{aligned}\\] Oh my! It's much more complex than our simple example. In this equation, we have a few more terms: \\(Parity\\) is the proportion of cows that are multiparous (ranges from 0 to 1) \\(BCS\\) is the body condition score from 1 (thin) to 5 (obese) \\(BW\\) is the bodyweight in kg \\(MilkE\\) is the energy produced in milk, in Mcal/d \\(DIM\\) is the day in milk, an integer number of days since the start of lactation Test yourself Which term is the intercept in this equation? BW13.7 On the one hand, we can use this equation without knowing how it works...we just plug in values for the known variables and get our estimate of DMI. Woohoo! But to be responsible animal nutritionists, we should probably dig a bit deeper into the relationships implied by the equation. The intercept tells us the expected value of the dependent variable (Y) when all of the independent variables (Xs) are set to zero. In this case, the intercept suggests that there is a small amount of DMI (3.7 kg) predicted even if all other variables are entered as zeroes. Each regression coefficient describes the magnitude and direction of a relationship between an independent variable and the dependent variable. In this equation, there are several terms with positive coefficients (Parity, MilkE, BW). These suggest that a greater proportion of multiparous cows, greater milk energy production, andg greater bodyweight are predictive of greater DMI (positive relationship). The last part of the equation includes some complex terms where there are interactions. In an interaction, two variables (e.g., milk production and BW) are multiplied with each other rather than added. Additionally, Euler's constant \\(e\\) appears in the expression \\(e^{(-0.053*DIM)}\\). This part is an adjustment for depressed intake in early lactation. 5.2.6 Prediction using software Although this math can be done on paper or with a calculator, if you are so inclined, you can try this in your favorite computer program.

Optimization involves writing an objective function describing the goal (e.g., the lowest cost ration, the most environmentally-favorable ration), listing out a set of constraints (e.g., nutrient requirements, available feeds), and using an optimization technique (e.g., linear optimization) to find the best possible solution(s). As an example, we could write an objective function that minimizes the total cost of a ration containing \\(n\\) feeds, where each feed \\(i\\) has its own cost \\(c_i\\) and a certain inclusion rate \\(x_i\\) in the diet. The \"objective\" function is a mathematical way of stating our ultimate goal (our objective). \\[ \\begin{equation*} \\text{minimize } \\sum_{i=1}^{n_i} c_i x_i \\end{equation*} \\] In other words if we have several feeds numbered 1 to \\(n\\), we want to minimize the sum of the total diet cost. The total diet cost is calculated by weighting the feed ingredient costs (\\(c_i\\)) by the feed ingredient inclusion rate \\(x_i\\). \\[= \\text{minimize } c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + ... + c_nx_n \\] Next, we can write some constraints that express mathematically what we consider feasible diets. For example, we may want the nutrient composition to fall within a certain range. On a DM basis, we know that: Feed 1 is 10% protein and 40% NDF. Feed 2 is 30% protein and 10% NDF. Feed 3 is 50% protein and 30% NDF. Weighting by the inclusion rates, we can write an equation for the protein and NDF concentration in the diet: Diet protein concentration (% of DM) = \\(10x_1 + 30x_2 + 50x_3\\) Diet NDF concentration (% of DM) = $40x_1 + 10x_2 + 30x_3 $ Then we can set these equations to be greater or less than certain numbers to constrain the diet composition. We want our inclusion rates to add up to 1 so we have the proportion of each feed entering the diet. Clearly, we cannot have negative inclusion rates for any feeds, so we need to add constraints to make sure all inclusion rates are greater than or equal to zero. To summarize the constraints: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{Protein concentration} \\quad &amp; 10x_1 + 30x_2 + 50x_3 \\geq 15 \\\\ \\text{NDF concentration} \\quad &amp; 40x_1 + 10x_2 + 30x_3 \\geq 25 \\\\ \\text{NDF concentration} \\quad &amp; 40x_1 + 10x_2 + 30x_3 \\leq 35 \\\\ \\text{Ingredient proportions sum} \\quad &amp; x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1 \\\\ \\text{amount of ingredients cannot be negative} \\quad &amp; \\begin{cases} x_1 \\geq 0 \\\\ x_2 \\geq 0 \\\\ x_3 \\geq 0 \\end{cases} \\end{align*} \\] Feasible region for optimization example. Only certain combinations of x1, x2, and x3 are feasible given our constraints. In three dimensions, our constraint equations form a polygonol plane - the feasible region. Unfeasible combinations that do not meet the constraints we specified fall outside of the blue shape. If we had more than three ingredients, we would have more than three dimensions, which becomes difficult to imagine. The constraints would form a polyhedron in n-dimensional space. Set up as amounts per 100 kg of feed (in nutrient matrix and others) also get costs per 100 kg feed. Finally, to optimize, we need to know our feed costs (USD / kg feed DM). As usual, it is very important to keep track of the units and the basis (dry matter or as-is). Feed 1 = $0.15 Feed 2 = $0.20 Feed 3 = $0.50 Literature deep dive Optimization is used widely in finance, engineering, economics, and other fields. Yet some of the first recorded uses of linear optimization are for nutrition. For example, during World War II, the mathematician George Dantzig took a leave from his doctoral program to serve as an analyst for the U.S. Air Force. Tasked with finding affordable and nutritionally-adequate meals, Dantzig used his mathematics training to design an algorithm that is still widely-used today. As summarized by Van Dooren (2018): Dantzig tested his model on his own diet, constructing a database with 50 foods. He wanted to reduce his caloric intake to 1,500 kcal and programmed an objective function to maximize the feeling of being full (operationalized as the weight per unit minus the weight of its water content). The solution he found was a weird diet with 200 bouillon cubes per day. This was possible because the former nutritional requirements didn't show a limit to the amount of salt. These results led to upper bounds being added to LP for the first time. This illustrates the complexity of setting up optimization problems, and the necessity for double-checking that the results are applicable to the real world! Van Dooren, C. (2018).

Yet the relationship is not necessarily linear. Instead, nutritionists use allometric equations to estimate how body processes (e.g., basal metabolic rate) will scale to animals with different body weights. Allometric equations are those that relate body weight to physiological and anatomical features. They have the general form \\(y = a * BW^b\\), where \\(a\\) is the intercept when \\(BW\\) = 1, \\(BW\\) is the body weight, and \\(b\\) is the scaling parameter. There are two major theories explaining allometric scaling: In 1883, Rubner proposed that surface area was an important determinant of metabolic rate. Smaller animals have a greater surface area to volume ratio than larger animals, and therefore require a faster metabolic rate. Heat is dissipated through the surface. This led to a scaling of metabolic rate of \\(BW^{0.67}\\). In the 1930s, Kleiber originally empirically derived the \\(BW^{0.75}\\) scaling relationship across mammals. West and Brown (2005) proposed that the fluid dynamics of blood within the fractal branching of the circulatory system determine the metabolic rate. This leads to metabolic scaling of \\(BW^{0.75}\\) in most animals. In very small animals, they proposed that blood viscosity increasingly determines blood flow, leading to a scaling of metabolic rate closer to \\(BW^{0.67}\\). Figure 5.2: Surface area and volume for cubes with increasing side length The idea of surface area and volume scaling differently might make more sense if we consider a cube of increasing size. \\(Surface \\space Area \\space (A) = 6s^2\\) \\(Volume \\space (V) = s^3\\) Side Length (s) Surface Area (A) Volume (V) 1 6 1 2 24 8 3 54 27 4 96 64 5 150 125 6 216 216 7 294 343 8 384 512 9 486 729 10 600 1000 Figure 5.3: Allometric scaling example for cattle West and Brown's (2005) BW^0.75 concept is somewhat harder to visualize. Still, we can picture somewhat how it works by imagining the fractal branching of the circulatory system. Figure 5.4: A fractal tree illustrating branching similar to circulation in the animal.

Learning Objectives List and explain two major theories of intake regulation. Discuss how animal, diet, and other factors influence dry matter intake. Use NASEM (2021) equations to predict dry matter intake. 6.1 Introduction to DMI Dry matter intake (DMI) is critically important in animal nutrition because it establishes the amount of nutrients available to the animal. When balancing rations, the nutritionist must predict the amount of dry matter the animal will consume. The accurate prediction of DMI is formulate balanced rations. If actual DMI is less than expected, the animal will be underfed nutrients and fed a ration that is too \"diluted\" to meet its needs. This may have implications on health and productivity. If DMI is greater than predicted, the animal will be fed a ration that is too \"concentrated\" in nutrients. Over-consumption of nutrients is typically more expensive and can increase environmental outputs. 6.2 Two theories of DMI regulation NASEM (2021) alludes to two major theories of intake regulation in ruminants: physical fill feedback and fuel-sensing. These theories explain why certain animal, diet, and environmental factors affect DMI. Physical fill limitations The physical fill (distension) of the gastrointestinal tract can signal satiety the the body. For example, researchers have inflated balloons in the stomachs of humans and other animals and shown that it decreased hunger (reviewed by Allen, 1996). The gastrointestinal tract only has room for a certain amount of digesta, so there are limitations to DMI based on the degree of physical fullness. Fuel-sensing Allen (2014) explained that ruminants can sense the body energy status that the ruminant liver can sense the body's energy status and send signals (afferents) to the brain to stimulate or inhibit feeding. This is referred to as hepatic oxidation theory (hepatic = related to the liver; oxidation = breakdown of fuels). Literature Deep Dive: One of the articles mentioned by the NASEM (2021) committee is a famous study done by Conrad (1964). This figure from Conrad (1964) shows how DMI rises as digestibility improves from 52 to about 67% of DM. This could correspond to feeding \"higher quality\" feeds, which result in less rumen distension and pass through the digestive tract more quickly. If gut fill is not a limitation, the animal is able to eat progressively more as digestibility increases. However, there is a point (here, estimated at 67% digestibility), after which feed intake declines with increasing digestibility. One possible reason is that the animal's hunger and satiety signals stop them from eating more. This is referred to as \"fuel-sensing.\" Figure 6.2: Figure from Conrad et al., (1964) depicting the transition from physical fill determination of DMI to fuel-sensing. Source: Conrad, H. R., Pratt, A. D., &amp; Hibbs, J. W. (1964). Regulation of feed intake in dairy cows. I. Change in importance of physical and physiological factors with increasing digestibility. Journal of Dairy Science, 47(1), 54-62. https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(64)88581-7 Analogy to humans: 🥬 vs. 🥜 If you prefer to think in human terms, picture a very unrealistic situation, in which a person loves lettuce (a high fiber, low digestibility food). This person loves lettuce so much that they are trying to meet their caloric needs by eating a lettuce-only diet. This person would have to eat a massive amount of lettuce...something like 30-50 pounds...to meet their requirement for kilocalories. But the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) will only physically hold a certain volume of digesta. Additionally, lettuce is difficult to digest, so it passes through the GIT slowly. Therefore, this person would probably reach a physical fill limitation to their DMI before their energy needs were met. Note that we have only discussed energy requirements, although there could likely be a shortage of nutrients too. The lettuce-loving person is analogous to a ruminant consuming low-digestibility diet (sometimes referred to as \"low-quality diet\"). Now picture a person who loves peanut butter (a low-fiber, high-digestibility food). This person can meet their energy requirement by eating a small volume of peanut butter. Because it is easily digested, it will move more quickly through the GIT. Therefore, the physical fill of the GIT does not limit their DMI. Instead, fuel-sensing signals will regulate intake. This person could have a relatively non-distended GIT and not feel hungry, because the liver senses an influx in energy and sends satiety signals to the brain. The peanut-butter-eating person is analogous to an animal consuming a high-digestibility diet. 6.3 Animal factors Thinking about the theories of intake regulation, we can see why certain animal factors affect DMI. Body weight increases the size of the digestive tract, allowing a greater volume of feed intake before physical fill limitations occur. Greater body weight also increases the animal's demand for nutrients, meaning that more feed will be required before satiety signals are triggered. Greater body condition score (BCS) near calving is associated with greater oxidation fatty acids derived from body reserves. As explained by the hepatic oxidation theory, this can lead to satiety signaling and decreased intake, potentially throughout the postpartum period. Milk production is another important factor in determining DMI. Milk production demands a tremendous amount of nutrients and energy. The need for nutrients and energy can sometimes cause the animal to feel hungrier, because the body senses that energy supply is insufficient relative to energy demand (Allen and Bradford, 2012). The consensus report does not explain why Parity affects DMI. However, there are several potential reasons. Compared to primiparous cows, multiparous cows have a larger digestive tract relative to their body size. This anatomical difference may affect their DMI independent of BW. Additionally, multiparous cows may have differences in satiety signaling compared to primiparous cows. 6.4 Diet factors Various aspects of diet composition can affect DMI. For example, diets that are too dry (hay only) or wet (fresh pasture) can negatively affect DMI. Certain nutrient imbalances (e.g., too much fat or quickly-fermentable carbohydrates) can suppress the function of rumen microbes, causing feed to stay longer in the rumen and suppressing intake. These factors are discussed in greater detail in NASEM (2021), but not included in predictive equations. Originally, researchers thought that dietary fiber (NDF) was the most important factor to determining DMI (Mertens, 1994). This is a reasonable theory for a few reasons. First, the volume of a ration (or any particular feed ingredient) is closely related to its fiber content. Long-chopped forages are sources of fiber that have a large volume per unit of weight (low density). In contrast, concentrates are generally lower in fiber and have a low volume per unit of weight (high density). This difference in density means that higher fiber rations create more physical fill per unit of DMI. Second, fiber takes longer to digest than other nutrients, so it often passes more slowly through the digestive tract. High fiber diets could lead to physical fill limitations because they would decrease the rate of passage and increase the amount of digesta in the animal at any given point in time. Both of these principles have been tested over several decades of research and seem to be true. However, eventually researchers also found that the physical form of fibrous feeds affected DMI (Dado and Allen, 1995). For example, fiber from forages (fNDF) was less dense and passed slowly through the digestive tract, and limited intake. Conversely, fiber from concentrate sources such as byproducts (non-forage NDF) was fairly dense, passed relatively quickly through the digestive tract, and did not affect physical fill to the same extent. Therefore, it became important to differentiate between forage and non-forage fiber in determining DMI. 6.5 Other factors The NASEM (2021) committee also discussed several other factors affecting DMI. Although these factors were not included in predictive equations, they mentioned a few important points: Eating habits and cow behavior - Feed availability affects how much cows eat. When cows have 24/7 access to feed, they may change their eating habits. Additionally, DMI can be affected by social interactions. Cows that are socially dominant tend to out-compete less-dominant peers to access the feed bunk. If bunk space is limited, this can drastically affect DMI. Feeding frequency - Increasing the frequency of feeding or pushing up feed (moving feed closer to cows) has been shown to affect eating behavior, which may affect DMI. Sorting - Sorting is when animals selectively consume some parts of the ration and not others. Typically, animals may sort out longer particles or dust, and selectively consume energy-dense or shorter-particle fractions. This means that the ration actually consumed by the animal can be different than the ration fed. Weather - Cold ambient temperatures are predicted to increase DMI, whereas heat stress typically decreases DMI. 6.6 DMI in NASEM (2021) NASEM (2021) gives the following equation to predict DMI for lactating Holsteins: Eq. 2-1, p. 12 \\[\\begin{aligned} DMI (kg/d) &amp;= [3.7 + (5.7*Parity) + \\\\ &amp;\\quad (0.305*MilkE) + \\\\ &amp;\\quad (0.022*BW) + \\\\ &amp;\\quad (-0.689-1.87*Parity)*BCS]*\\\\ &amp;\\quad [1-(0.212+0.136*Parity)*e^{(-0.053*DIM)}] \\end{aligned}\\] \\(Parity\\) is the proportion of cows that are multiparous (ranges from 0 to 1) \\(BCS\\) is the body condition score from 1 (thin) to 5 (obese) \\(BW\\) is the bodyweight in kg \\(MilkE\\) is the energy produced in milk, in Mcal/d \\(DIM\\) is the day in milk, an integer number of days since the start of lactation Although various aspects of the diet can affect DMI, NASEM (2021) considers mainly fiber and forage fiber content in determining physical fill limitations. NASEM (2021) gives the following equation to predict DMI for lactating Holsteins based on both animal and diet factors: Eq. 2-2, p. 13 \\[\\begin{aligned} DMI (kg/d) &amp;= 12.0-(0.107*fNDF) + \\\\ &amp;\\quad (8.17*ADF/NDF) + \\\\ &amp;\\quad (0.0253*fNDFD) + \\\\ &amp;\\quad (-0.328*(ADF/NDF-0.602)) * (fNDFD-48.3) +\\\\ &amp;\\quad (0.225*MY) +\\\\ &amp;\\quad 0.00390*(fNDFD-48.3)*(MY-33.1) \\end{aligned}\\] \\(fNDF\\) is the forage NDF content of the diet as a percentage of diet DM \\(ADF/NDF\\) is the ADF content of the diet (% of DM) divided by the NDF content of the diet (% of DM) \\(fNDFD\\) is the digestibility of forage NDF measured in vitro or in situ \\(MY\\) is the milk yield, in kg/d Forage NDF is determined by summing the NDF from forage sources. Starting with a list of ingredients and inclusion rates (% of DM), 1) Find out which ingredients are forages. This is listed in the NASEM (2021) Feed Library. 2) Determine the NDF content of the forage feeds as a percentage of ingredient DM. 3) Compute a weighted sum of forage ingredient NDF, where the weights are the inclusion rates of each forage ingredient \\(i\\) in the diet. \\[fNDF = \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\text{n forages in diet}} w_i(NDF_i)\\] \\(fNDF\\) is the sum of forage ingredient NDF, expressed as a percentage of diet DM (kg NDF from forages / 100 kg diet DM). \\(w_i\\) is the weighting factor, the inclusion rate of feed \\(i\\) in the diet as a proportion (kg ingredient / 1 kg diet). \\(NDF_i\\) is the NDF content of the forage ingredient \\(i\\) as a percentage of DM (kg NDF / 100 kg ingredient). Example fNDF calculation: Inclusion of ingredients in diet (\\(w_i\\), proportion of diet DM) Corn silage 0.4 Alfalfa silage 0.2 Other non-forage ingredients 0.4 NDF content of ingredients (\\(NDF_i\\), % of ingredient DM) Corn silage 45% Alfalfa silage 42% \\[(0.4*45)+(0.2*42)\\\\fNDF = 26.4\\text{% of diet DM} \\] Importantly, the fNDFD is expressed as a percentage of forage NDF, in other words, the kg of digestible forage NDF per 100 kg of forage NDF. The ADF/NDF ratio is included as a proxy for forage fragility. Fragility is a measure of how readily the feed breaks apart when chewed by the animal, which affects its behavior throughout the digestive tract. Which equation should I use? It is up to the nutritionist to decide which DMI equation is most appropriate. For example, when a diet with a large amount of forage NDF is fed, it may be reasonable to use Eq. 2-2 because physical fill limitations may play a large role in determining DMI. In contrast, Eq. 2-1 may be useful when trying to estimate DMI separately for groupings based on animal factors. For example, farms may group primiparous and multiparous cattle separately and feed them separate rations. It is also common to feed a separate ration for cows with very high milk production. Determining DMI for these groups requires an equation that accounts for animal effects. 6.7 Examples 6.7.1 NASEM dairy-8 Show NASEM dairy 8 example Open NASEM dairy-8.

Discuss why chemical compounds differ in their potential metabolic/combustion energy. 7.1 Introduction The opening picture for this chapter shows sawdust, ground corn, a dairy cow, and a fire. This is to illustrate two energy sources (sawdust and ground corn) and two energy reactors (dairy cow and fire). By combining a source and reactor within certain environmental conditions, we create a system. Assuming similar environmental conditions, we can explore a few hypothetical options. Burn the sawdust and ground corn. If you burnt a similar amount of both substances in a fire, which substance would give off more heat? Feed the sawdust and ground corn to a lactating dairy cow. If you fed the sawdust and ground corn to a lactating dairy cow, which substance could the cow derive more energy from? Potential energy is a property of a system, not just one substance. In physics, energy is often discussed in relation to mechanical work (movement). A system could consist of a ball at the top of a hill, which has potential energy. In chemistry, we discuss chemical potential energy, the energy \"contained\" in chemical bonds. Here, a system could involve reactants at certain temperature, pressure, and other conditions. Chemical potential energy refers to the energy that could be released during reactions, when bonds are broken and formed. In nutrition, we generally discuss chemical potential energy and the system is always animal metabolism. Nutritionists categorize various chemicals based on their potential to produce energy within the metabolic reactions occurring inside animals. In this chapter, we will discuss some basic principles of energy from chemistry, physics, and biology. Then, we'll delve into their application to animal nutrition. The chapter will also provide some hints about how energy is considered in the NASEM (2021) dairy nutrition model. Test Yourself: True or false: energy is a nutrient. TRUEFALSE click here for an explanation Although energy is required by the dairy cow, it is not a nutrient. The nutrients fat, carbohydrate, and protein yield energy. 7.2 Chemical/physical laws Animals, like everything else on earth, must follow the Laws of Thermodynamics: The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Energy can be transferred or converted from one form to another. As it pertains to animal nutrition, Weiss (2008) summarized this as \"energy input must equal energy output plus or minus any change in body energy.\" This is the \"conservation of energy\" principle discussed in the Systems Concepts chapter of this textbook. In nutrition, this principle is built-into the energy scheme where the total input energy (gross energy) must equal the sum of the energy in output and transformation flows (NE, and energy in heat, urine, feces, and gas emissions). The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy, or disorder, of a system tends to increase over time. Increases in entropy always result in the release of heat. In nutrition, this means that some loss of energy (from the animal) as heat during metabolism is inevitable. This law also applies in other situations. When a person drives a gasoline-powered car, the potential energy contained in the fuel cannot be perfectly turned into mechanical energy, and some is released as heat. It is also important to remember that this law applies to closed systems. 7.3 Measuring energy with calorimetry For several hundred years, calorimetry has been the main way used to measure energy involved in chemical processes. In direct calorimetry, a container of water is placed around a small chamber. Inside the chamber, a substance is burned. When substances burn in open air, they release energy in several forms, including heat, light, and sound. The amount of heat production is directly proportional to (not equal to) the potential energy content of the substance when oxidized. The researcher measures the temperature change in the surrounding water. Calorimetry works because of the conservation of energy. The energy released by burning a substance is not created or destroyed...it is transferred to the surrounding water. Indirect calorimetry Another way to study energy metabolism is through indirect calorimetry. In this method, heat production is not directly measured. Instead, the composition of exhaled gas is analyzed to estimate the consumption of \\(O_2\\) and production of \\(CO_2\\) over time. From these quantities, it is possible to infer the amount of heat production as well as the types of fuels being used. In human medicine, a device called a metabolic cart is used for indirect calorimetry. The patient rests quietly while breathing into a face mask or other device that measures their exhaled gases. This type of analysis can be used to estimate resting metabolic rate (sometimes called basal metabolic rate). In dairy cattle nutrition, face masks are not practical. Instead, researchers create stalls for animals inside sealed rooms called respiratory chambers. By measuring the gas entering and leaving the respiratory chamber, they can make predictions about metabolism. Calorimetry was invented more than 200 years ago by a French nobleman named Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) and French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827). These two were the first to propose an interesting question: Is an animal's energy metabolism analogous to a fire? Lavoisier and Laplace did experiments to test this hypothesis using calorimeters. First, they burnt feeds in the calorimeters with a small flame. This reaction consumed oxygen (\\(O_2\\)) and produced (\\(CO_2\\)), water (\\(H_2O\\)), heat, light, and sound. Then, they found an animal small enough to sit inside the calorimeter--a mouse! As the mouse sat inside the calorimeter, its metabolic reactions consumed (\\(O_2\\)) and produced (\\(CO_2\\)), water (\\(H_2O\\)), heat, and movement. As a result of these experiments, it became clear that burning substances (combustion, an oxidation process) was similar to metabolism (which involves other oxidation processes). The equations for metabolism and combustion of energy-containing nutrients (carbohydrates, fats, amino acids, etc.) are similar in form. Both processes can be described simply as follows: \\[Fuel + O_2 \\rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O + energy\\] Another interesting result from early calorimetry studies was the finding that certain substances released more heat when burned compared to others. This led to another question... During oxidation, why do some substances seem to release more energy than others? To figure this out, we need to delve into a little chemistry. What's happening when we combust a substance? First, the initial supply of heat applied to the substance (a match or bunsen burner) decomposes the substance's chemical macrostructure, breaking larger molecules (polymers) into smaller molecules (monomers). Then, the smaller molecules can chemically react with oxygen as shown in the equation above. The amount of energy produced by the combustion reaction depends on which monomers are reacting with oxygen, and what bonds are they contain. With respect to nutrition, you may have heard that fats provide more energy than carbohydrates or proteins when metabolized. A common rule of thumb states that the kilocalories per gram supplied by fats \\(\\approx\\) 9, proteins \\(\\approx\\) 4, and carbohydrates \\(\\approx\\) 4. To see why, we can compare a fat monomer (palmitic acid) with a carbohydrate monomer (glucose). Figure 7.2: Comparison of bonds in a fat monomer, palmitic acid (A), with a carbohydrate monomer (B) glucose, and a protein monomer, lysine (C). Test Yourself: What do you notice about these molecules? Which molecule has the greatest percentage of C-C and C-H bonds? palmitic acidglucoselysine Palmitic acid contains a large percentage of C-C and C-H bonds: C-C 15 C-H 31 C=0 1 C-O 1 O-H 1 In contrast, glucose contains a mixture of C-C, C-H, C-O, C=O bonds: C-C 5 C-O 5 C=O 1 O-H 5 C-H 7 When molecules containing lots of C-C and C-H are combusted, many C-C and C-H bonds are broken, and many C=O and O-H bonds are formed in the \\(CO_2\\) and \\(H_2O\\) products. In relation to oxidation, C-C and C-H bonds have more potential energy than some other types of bonds (e.g., C-O). Another way to think of this is that C-H and C-C bonds are less stable than C-O bonds. This is because O is more electronegative and has a stronger \"desire\" for electrons than C or H (C, H, and O; 2.5, 2.2, and 3.4 electronegativity respectively, on Pauling scale). Therefore, a C-C or C-H bond is like a ball at the top of a hill...it is unstable (weak bond) and has a lot of potential energy. A C-O bond is like a ball at the bottom of a hill. It is more stable (strong bond) and has less potential energy. Moving from the less-stable to more-stable state releases energy, like a ball rolling down a hill. Another way to think about heat production is through bond enthalpies. Through experiments, chemists have determined the average energy associated with dissociation of certain bonds at standard temperature and pressure, in a gas phase. The table gives some examples of the energy associated with different types of bonds. Importantly, these must be interpreted with respect to a system (i.e., a reaction in certain conditions, typically standard temperature and pressure and gaseous phase reactants). Bond Average Bond Enthalpy (kJ/mol) C-H 413 C-C 348 C-O 358 O=O 498 C=O 805 O-H 464 Combustion of methane If your house has a gas stove, you have probably combusted methane to produce heat. The reaction can be described like this: \\[CH_4 (g) + 2O_2 (g) \\rightarrow CO_2 (g) + 2H_2O (l)\\] In this reaction, some bonds are broken: 4 mol C-H 2 mol O=O and some bonds are formed: 2 mol C=O 4 mol H-O It is possible to estimate the heat produced by this reaction using average bond enthalpies. Importantly, average bond enthalpies apply to gases. If one of the reactants or products is a liquid, the calculation must include an extra step to account for the enthalpy change of vaporization. Bond enthalpies (\\(kJ \\space mol^{-1}\\)) C-H +413 O=O +498 C=O in carbon dioxide +805 O-H +464 Conversion of water from liquid to gas +41 (enthalpy change of vaporization) Enthalpy change = bonds broken - bonds formed Enthalpy change = \\([4*413 + 2*498] - [2*805 + 4*464 + 2*41]\\) = \\(-900 \\space kJ\\) This means that approximately 900 kJ of heat are given off (applied to the surroundings) as a result of this reaction. Here, we can also see that going from weaker C-H bonds to stronger C=O and O-H bonds releases energy to the surroundings. 7.4 Biological importance of energy Energy is involved in every chemical reaction in the body. Collectively, the entire sum of reactions that maintain an organism's life is referred to as Metabolism. During metabolism, energy is transferred through oxidation and reduction reactions. Metabolism includes catabolic and anabolic reactions. In catabolism, larger molecules such as proteins, fats, and carbohydrates are gradually broken down and oxidized, producing carbon dioxide and water, and releasing energy to the surroundings. Examples of catabolism include proteolysis, glycogenolysis, and lipolysis. The processes of digesting feed and mobilizing body reserves are catabolic. As a whole, catabolism is exergonic, i.e., it releases energy to its surroundings. In anabolism, larger molecules are built from smaller molecules. This results in storage of energy within the animal system. Overall, anabolism is endergonic--storing energy. Examples of anabolism include protein synthesis, glycogenesis, and lipogenesis. In dairy cattle, the synthesis of fats, proteins, and lactose in milk are anabolic processes that requires a great deal of energy. Energy is required to maintain the constant balance of catabolic and anabolic processes that maintains life. These reactions not only grow and remodel the body's physical form, they also produce the heat that maintains the animal's body temperature at the conditions required to survive in its environment. In skeletal muscle, chemical energy is converted to mechanical energy so the animal can move around. In summary, energy is central to nearly every process involved in an organism's function. 7.5 Energy in nutritional processes In human and animal nutrition, energy is defined in relation to ordered nutritional processes. This conceptualization of energy has existed for decades and is not particular to the NASEM (2021) model. Figure 7.3: Fractionation of energy within an animal nutritional system. Gross Energy (GE) represents the total amount of chemical energy in a feed before undergoing any digestive processes. The amount of GE depends solely on the chemical composition (i.e., nutrient fractions) of the feed, so GE does not change for different animal characteristics. For this reason, estimation of GE is very precise. However, GE is not very useful for diet formulation because not all the energy can be digested, metabolized, or used for body functions. Digestible Energy (DE) is the energy remaining after subtracting fecal energy losses. DE requires estimation of the digestibility of feed nutrients ([intake - fecal excretion]/intake), which depends on animal factors. Therefore, DE is estimated using animal trials where feed energy intakes and fecal energy outputs are recorded. Additionally, scientists have developed in vitro assays that mimic digestion processes and can be used to estimate DE. Because DE is affected by animal factors, DE estimates are less precise than GE. Metabolizable Energy (ME) is the energy that can support body functions such as growth, movement, lactation, and accretion of body reserves. ME is calculated as the energy remaining after accounting for losses in feces, urine, and gas. Compounds excreted in urine contain some energy (urea,\\(CH_4N_2O\\) accounts for a large fraction of urine energy), and enteric fermentation releases gases that contain some energy (methane, \\(CH_4\\)). These are counted as energetic losses because the body has not completely oxidized the compound to \\(CO_2\\) and there is still some energy remaining. Measuring ME involves not only measuring DE, but also collecting and conducting calorimetry on urine samples, and measuring gas production. Because of these additional sources of error, ME estimates are even less precise than DE. Net Energy (NE) is the energy that is actually does support body functions such as growth, movement, lactation, and accretion of body reserves. NE is calculated as ME minus the heat released in metabolic reactions. Although it is possible to measure the heat produced by an animal in a whole-animal calorimeter, this is rarely done in practice (Weiss, 2008). Although NE estimates are less precise, it is perhaps the most useful energy quantity for nutritionists, because we are focused on predicting animal health and performance outcomes. Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise. John Tukey, The future of data analysis. Annals of Mathematical Statistics 33 (1), (1962), page 13. Test Yourself: Which of the fractions above could you determine using only a calorimeter and feed, without an animal or other laboratory equipment? GEDEMENE Which fraction requires using calorimetry to determine urine energy losses? GEDEME True or false: you could determine DE by burning feed and feces in a calorimeter. TRUEFALSE Which of the fractions above accounts for energy lost as heat? GEDEMENE True or false: GE is the most useful fraction for ration formulation. TRUEFALSE 7.6 Conclusions Let's return to the hypothetical scenarios originally posed at the beginning of the chapter. Use what you learned in this chapter to try to answer the questions. Scenario: Burn sawdust and ground corn. Assume you are given sawdust and ground corn that had similar GE values on a DM basis (Mcal GE per g DM). If you burnt the same amount (g of DM) of both substances in a fire, which substance would give off more heat? Why? click here for an answer Both substances have similar GE values. This means that they will produce a similar amount of heat when burnt. Neither will produce more heat...the amount of heat produced for each will be similar. Feed the sawdust and ground corn to a lactating dairy cow. If you fed the same GE-equivalent sawdust and ground corn to a lactating dairy cow, which substance could the cow derive more energy from? You can assume the sawdust is less digestible than the corn grain. Explain your reasoning in terms of GE, DE, ME, and NE. click here for an answer Although both substances have similar GE values, the lower digestibility of sawdust means that its value to the animal is less than that of corn grain. Because DE for sawdust will be lower than corn grain, ME and NE will also be lower. Thus, the sawdust has less energy value to the cow than the corn grain, despite both substances having similar GE values. Just for fun: Look at the \"Nutrition Facts\" label on a human food item. The label shows the grams of metabolizable fat, protein, and carbohydrates in the food. Use the macronutrient composition to get a rough approximation of the kilocalorie content of the food, using the rule of thumb: kilocalories per gram supplied by fats \\(\\approx\\) 9, proteins \\(\\approx\\) 4, and carbohydrates \\(\\approx\\) 4. Note that kcal are often abbreviated as \"calories\" in human nutrition. Check against the calorie content reported on the label. Do they match?

Explain the steps to calculate ME from DE in NASEM (2021). 8.1 Energy intake (gross energy) In NASEM (2021), the first step in determining the energy value of a feed is estimating its gross energy (GE) content. As discussed in the last chapter, GE can be measured using a calorimeter. However, it is also possible to estimate GE using the feed chemical composition. Estimating GE from a feed's chemical composition is the first step in predicting energy supplies in the NASEM (2021) model. Figure 8.2: Gross energy content of selected feeds. Source: NASEM (2021) Library Pause and think What do you notice about the GE content of the feeds shown? You may have noticed that these feeds split into roughly three categories: 1) very energy-dense fat supplements, 2) feeds with moderate energy-density, and 3) vitamins and minerals with zero energy. You may have also noticed that the energy contents of feeds with mostly fat are close to 9 Mcal/kg DM, whereas feeds with more carbohydrate and protein are closer to 4 Mcal/kg DM. This is close to the rule of thumb learned in the last chapter (approx. 9, 4, and 4 kcal/g for fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, respectively). The 9-4-4 rule of thumb is helpful in human nutrition, yet in animal nutrition it has some limitations. First, it is a rough approximation. Human \"diet formulation\" is often more approximate and ad hoc, whereas in animal nutrition we typically want to be quite precise. Second, animals consume a variety of feedstuffs that humans do not, including forages and non-protein nitrogen (NPN) feeds. In this chapter, we will see how the NASEM (2021) model uses a method to estimate gross energy that is similar to the 9-4-4 rule of thumb. However, it includes more feed fractions (not just fat, protein, carbohydrates) and accommodates some of the unique aspects of ruminant diets (e.g., NPN). Note on terminology NASEM (2021) refers to the chemical fractions used in energy calculation (e.g., NDF, starch, ROM) as \"feed fractions\" or \"uniform fractions.\" For conceptual clarity, we will refer to these chemical fractions as \"OM fractions.\" This is because OM fractions can be applied at the feed and diet level, so it may confuse some learners to refer to them as \"feed fractions.\" Additionally, not all of the fractions behave as \"uniform fractions,\" per se (e.g., Starch), as acknowledged in the NASEM (2021) chapter. 8.2 GE from OM fractions The first two steps in the NASEM (2021) energy scheme are as follows: 1) Separate energy-containing matter into “mostly uniform” fractions, and 2) Calculate gross energy values for each fraction. To estimate GE based on chemical composition, the feed (or ration) must be divided up into mostly-uniform fractions. Because the ash (minerals) in a feed do not supply any energy, only the organic matter (OM = DM - Ash) is considered. In NASEM (2021), these OM fractions are: NDF - neutral detergent fiber, which contains cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin Starch - which is a polymer of glucose FA - fatty acids that are greater than 4 carbons long; does not include short-chain volatile fatty acids or lactic acid. ROM - contains the organic matter left over after accounting for the other fractions; e.g., water-soluble carbohydrates, short-chain fatty acids, glycerol, and soluble fiber. CP-sNPNCPE - crude protein from rumen-degradable protein and rumen-undegradable protein, excluding CP from supplemental non-protein nitrogen (NPN). sNPNCPE - RDP from supplemental NPN, on a CP basis. These OM fractions are routinely assayed experimentally. Most of the OM fractions can be determined through wet chemistry (i.e., by using laboratory techniques). The exceptions are RDP and RUP, which require not only a laboratory analysis (for CP) but also an in situ or in vitro experiment (for distinguishing RDP vs. RUP). Each of these OM fractions has its own GE value, similar to the 9-4-4 rule-of-thumb, but more precise. These are given on p. 23 (NASEM, 2021) as the Mcal/kg of feed DM. NDF = 4.20 Starch = 4.23 FA = 9.40 ROM = 4.00 CP-sNPNCPE = 5.65 sNPNCPE = 0.89 Using these GE values, the GE content (Mcal/kg of DM) can be calculated using the OM fractions. This is given in Eq. 3-2, p. 23 (NASEM, 2021). The equations for GE can be applied to a single feed, or an entire diet. The examples moving forward assume that GE is calculated at the individual feed level (i.e., calculate GE separately for each feed). \\[ \\begin{align} \\text{GE_DM of feed or diet} &amp;= (0.042 * \\text{NDF_DM}) + \\\\ &amp; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (0.0423 * \\text{Starch_DM}) + \\\\ &amp; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (0.040 * \\text{ROM_DM} )+ \\\\ &amp; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (0.094 * \\text{FA_DM}) + \\\\ &amp; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 0.0565 *( \\text{CP_DM} - \\text{sNPNCPE_DM}) + \\\\ &amp; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (0.0089 * \\text{sNPNCPE_DM}) \\\\ \\end{align} \\] Where OM fractions are expressed as a percentage of DM. Note that in NASEM (2021), the GE values (Mcal/kg) were divided by 100 as shorthand to convert the OM fractions from percentages to proportions. Literature Deep Dive: Uniform Fractions Nutritionally uniform fractions are chemical fractions (e.g., NDF, ROM) where 1) the relationship between inclusion of the fraction in a diet (g of fraction/kg diet DM) and digestibility of the fraction (%) is linear, and 2) the relation of inclusion and digestibility appears similar regardless of the feeds that supplied the chemical fraction. In other words, if we think of uniform fraction as a nutrient, it doesn't matter which feed supplied the nutrient, because the nutrient itself is what affects animal performance. The original work to define uniform fractions (Lucas, 1964) resulted in the coining of the term \"the Lucas test.\" More recent work has been done to update this idea: Tebbe, A. W., Faulkner, M. J., &amp; Weiss, W. P. (2017). Effect of partitioning the nonfiber carbohydrate fraction and neutral detergent fiber method on digestibility of carbohydrates by dairy cows. Journal of dairy science, 100(8), 6218–6228. https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-12719 8.3 Base digestibilities of OM fractions The next step in energy fractionation is to 3) Calculate base digestibilities for each fraction assuming a certain DMI and starch content. The term \"base digestibilities\" refers to the digestibility of the fraction that is expected (based on experimentation) for an animal with a DMI at 3.5% of body weight fed a diet with 26% starch. The equations for base DE are simplest to calculate at the level of individual feeds. 8.3.1 NDF \\[\\text{dNDF_NDF} =\\frac{0.75 * (NDF - Lignin) * [1-(Lignin/NDF)^{0.667}]}{NDF}\\] Where \\(\\text{dNDF_NDF}\\) is the proportion of NDF digested at base conditions. \\(NDF\\) is the neutral detergent fiber content of the diet as a % of DM. \\(Lignin\\) is the lignin content of the diet as a % of DM. Because NDF is a uniform feed fraction, this equation can be used at the feed level or the diet level. 8.3.2 Starch Starch digestibility varies a great deal based on the feed processing, so it was not possible to have a single equation or digestibility coefficient that worked across all feeds. Instead, separate starch digestibilities are given in the Feed Library based on values determined experimentally. These are listed as dStarch_Starch. 8.3.3 CP The digested proportion of CP not from NPN sources (dCP_CP) is based on the protein model, which will be discussed in a later chapter. It is the sum of RDP and digestible RUP (dRUP). Base RUP and dRUP values are given in the Feed Library, so it is possible to calculate the dCP_CP without first completing the protein model. After subtracting RDP from NPN sources from the RDP, the dCP_CP can be calculated as: \\[\\text{dCP_CP} = RDP + dRUP\\] 8.3.4 sNPNCPE The narrative does not explicitly mention the digestibility of sNPNCPE. Because it is a component of RDP, the proportion of sNPNCPE digested is assumed to be 1.0, i.e., 100%. 8.3.5 ROM The base digestibility of ROM is 0.96 across all feeds. This shows that ROM is a highly-digestible feed fraction--it is nearly completely-digestible. 8.3.6 FA For most feeds, dFA_FA is set at 0.73. However, there is an exception for supplemental fats, where digestibilities are based on experimental data. 8.4 Summing to diet level The previous sections calculated GE and base digestibilities for each individual feed. In the next section, we need to apply diet-level adjustments. This requires that we start with the diet composition (% of diet DM), and the diet-level base digestibilities (%, unitless) of the OM fractions NDF, starch, CP (excluding sNPNCPE), sNPNCPE, ROM, and FA. Diet content of an OM Fraction (% of DM) For a given OM fraction (e.g., NDF) the feed-level composition (e.g., \\(NDF_i\\), % of individual feed DM) can be converted to the diet level by computing a weighted sum, where the weights (\\(w_i\\)) are the inclusion rate of each feed as a proportion of diet DM. For example: \\[\\text{NDF_DM, % of diet DM}= \\sum_{i = 1}^{n \\space feeds} ({NDF_i} * w_i)\\] Diet base digestibility of an OM Fraction (%) Calculating the diet-level base digestibility for an OM fraction is more complex. To continue the example using NDF, the base digestibility of NDF can be calculated as follows. For each individual feed, multiply the feed's NDF content (\\(NDF\\_DM_i\\), NDF, % of feed DM) by its base digestibility (\\(dNDF\\_NDF_i\\), %) and the feed's inclusion rate in the diet as a proportion of DM (\\(w_i\\), feed DM in diet DM). Sum the products for all feeds in the diet. This returns the digestible NDF as a percent of diet DM. Then, in the denominator, calculate the diet NDF (% of DM). Dividing the numerator by denominator returns the diet digestible NDF as a percent of diet NDF. The order of operations is important, because we want the OM fraction base digestibility coefficients for each feed to be multiplied by the amount of the OM fraction in that feed. \\[\\text{dNDF_NDF at diet-level}= \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n \\space feeds} ({dNDF\\_NDF_i} * NDF\\_DM_i * w_i)}{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n \\space feeds}{ (NDF\\_DM_i * w_i)}}\\] 8.5 Diet-level DE adjustments The next step is to 4) adjust the base digestibilities calculated at the feed level, to account for diet-level effects of NDF and starch content. Feeding excessive starch has been associated with decreased fiber digestibility due to changes in rumen microbial fermentation. It has been well-established that digestibility of certain nutrients (e.g., NDF, Starch) decreases as the animal's DMI increases. 8.5.1 dNDF_NDF adjustment To adjust the base NDF digestibility, NASEM (2021) offers the following equation 3-5a (p. 25): \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{dNDF_NDF_adjusted} &amp;= \\text{dNDF_NDF} - 0.0059*(Starch-26) \\\\ &amp; \\quad - 1.1*(\\text{DMI_BW}-0.035) \\end{aligned} \\] Where \\(\\text{dNDF_NDF}\\) is the base dNDF_NDF calculated previously \\(Starch\\) is the percentage of starch in diet DM (kg Starch / 100 kg diet DM) \\(\\text{DMI_BW}\\) is the DMI as a proportion of body weight (e.g., 3.0% of BW = 0.03). This equation suggests that the digestibility of NDF decreases as the level of dietary starch increases above 26% of DM, and as the DMI increases above 3.5% of the animal's bodyweight. Conversely, greater NDF digestibility is expected at lower dietary starch and lower DMI_BW. 8.5.2 dStarch_Starch adjustment Starch digestibility is also adjusted for the level of intake relative to the animal's body weight. An equation is given on p. 26 (NASEM, 2021). \\[\\text{dStarch_Starch_adjusted} = \\text{dStarch_Starch} - 1.0(\\text{DMI_BW} - 0.035)\\] This suggests that the digestibility of starch decreases as DMI increases above 3.5% of the animal's bodyweight. On the other hand, lower intake (% of BW) is expected to improve starch digestibility. 8.5.3 Other adjustments The other adjustment made by NASEM (2021) is a correction for endogenous CP and ROM. This is because most of the experimental data used to determine digestibility reported apparent digestibility. However, the true digestibility is most relevant to the energy flows. For details on digestibility calculations, see the Glossary. Apparent and true digestibilities are assumed to be the same for NDF, Starch, and FAs. For CP - sNPNCPE, the digestible energy values are corrected for the fecal energy from metabolic fecal protein (MFCP) and fecal microbial protein (fMCP). This correction involves subtracting the energy from endogenous CP from the predicted diet DE. A similar approach is used to predict endogenous fecal ROM (efROM), calculate its contribution to fecal energy, and subtract it from diet DE. These adjustments are discussed in detail in NASEM (2021, p. 27). 8.6 DE calculation To calculate DE, the GE value of each diet fraction is multiplied by the digestibility of that fraction. Then, the energy from each fraction is summed to yield the energy for the entire diet. The diet OM fractions (e.g., NDF, starch, FA, ROM) are input as a percentage of DM, so they should be a number between 0 and 100. Eq. 3-8 (NASEM, 2021, p. 27) \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{DE_DM; Mcal/kg of diet DM} &amp;= (0.042 * NDF\\_DM * dNDF\\_NDF\\_adjusted) + \\\\[6pt] &amp;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (0.0423 * Starch\\_DM * dStarch\\_Starch\\_adjusted) +\\\\[6pt] &amp;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (0.0940 * FA\\_DM * dFA\\_FA) +\\\\[6pt] &amp;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ [0.0565 * (RDP\\_DM- sNPNCPE\\_DM + dRUP\\_DM)] + \\\\[6pt] &amp;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (0.0089 * sNPNCPE\\_DM) +\\\\[6pt] &amp;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (0.040 * ROM\\_DM * 0.96) +\\\\[6pt] &amp;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (-0.00565 * MFCP) +\\\\[6pt] &amp;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (-0.00565 * fMCP)+\\\\[6pt] &amp;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (-0.0040 * efROM\\_DM) \\end{aligned} \\] The total DE intake (Mcal/d) can be calculated by multiplying the DE content of the diet (Mcal/kg of diet DM) by the animal's DMI (kg/d). This operation cancels out the \"kg\" leaving behind \"Mcal/d.\" \\[ \\text{DE, Mcal/d} = DE\\_DM * DMI\\] Figure 8.3: Base digestible energy content (Mcal/kg) of selected feeds, and the percentage of GE that is DE (grey rectangle). Source: NASEM (2021) Library Pause and think What do you notice about the DE content of the feeds shown, in comparison with their GE content? Why is it important to account for energy losses in feces? Energy losses in feces can represent about a third of GE intake, depending on the diet and animal characteristics. This makes fecal losses the largest loss of GE in the energy fractionation scheme. We can see clearly that fecal dry matter contains a fair amount of energy, because dried animal dung will readily burn, a renewable energy source that has been used for centuries!

Source: Wikipedia. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dung_cooking_fire._Pushkar_India.JPG 8.7 DE to ME To get from DE to ME, the next step is to 5) estimate urine energy (UE) and gas energy output (GasE, i.e., methane). The equations for estimating urine energy and gas energy are detailed in other chapters of NASEM (2021) as explained on p. 28. Urine energy is mainly a function of dietary N intake, since most urine energy losses are in the form of urea (a N compound). Gas energy is a function of DMI and the intake of fats and digestible fiber, because these factors affect methane production. Eq. 3-10b, p. 28 \\[ ME\\_DM = DE\\_DM - GasE\\_DM - UE\\_DM \\] Where all terms are expressed as Mcal/kg DMI. To convert this to the total amount of ME supplied by a diet, multiply ME_DM by the animal's DMI. \\[\\text{ME, Mcal/d} = ME\\_DM *DMI\\] Figure 8.5: Energy scheme discussed in last chapter, focused on DE to ME. 8.8 Conclusions In this chapter, we discussed how GE intake is fractionated into DE, ME, and energy losses in NASEM (2021). In the next chapter, we will discuss how ME supply contributes to meeting body needs as NE. 8.9 Examples. 8.9.1 NASEM dairy-8 Open NASEM dairy-8.

Learning Objectives List the body functions that are accounted for in the NASEM (2021) energy model. Explain how energy use is predicted within the NASEM (2021) model for various body functions. Convert ME to NEL, and convert different NE uses to an NEL basis. 9.1 Body functions in the energy model In the last chapter, we followed the flow of energy through ingestion, digestion, and absorption to find the available energy (ME) after accounting for fecal, urinary, and gaseous energy losses. In this chapter, we will first determine the predicted use of energy for various body functions (NE). Then we will discuss how ME can be converted to NE to meet the animal's needs. Note on terminology To facilitate learning, the energy scheme presented in this interactive textbook differs from NASEM (2021) in some of the terminology used and the ways equations are presented. First, it refers to Reserve Energy (RE) as an NE use, to be consistent with the Protein Chapter of NASEM (2021). Additionally, equations are modified to express energy first on an \"NE basis,\" meaning the energy actually assimilated or used by the body function. This modification is intended to ensure learners can grasp the concept of NEL before expressing other energy uses on an NEL basis. The NE basis can be converted to an NEL basis to match the NASEM (2021) consensus report, as described later in this chapter. 9.2 Maintenance The maintenance requirement of adult dairy cattle is calculated as follows: \\[NEMaintenance = 0.10 * BW^{0.75}\\] Where NEMaintenance is in Mcal/d and BW is in kg. Maintenance requirements have traditionally been determined by measuring fasting heat production in a respiratory chamber. In other words, this techniques involves measuring the heat losses of the animal's body (as a proxy for energy use), separately from the heat produced by digesting feed intake. Because respiratory chambers temporarily limit the animal's normal movements in order to do indirect calorimetry, these values do not reflect the energy expenditures of cattle moving around normally. The committee has adjusted predicted maintenance use to account for this. 9.3 Lactation Because milk composition is often measured, the NASEM (2021) consensus report provides a method to estimate the energy contained in milk based on its composition. This equation inflates the coefficient for true protein to account for the energy contained in milk urea, assuming milk urea is 5.5% of milk CP. \\[ \\text{NELactation} =[( 9.29*Fat) + (5.85*TP) + (3.95*Lactose)] * MilkProduction \\] Where Fat, TP, and Lactose are the kg of component per kg of milk. The part in brackets gives the NE content of milk (Mcal NE/ kg milk). To convert this to the total use of NE for milk production per day (NELactation, Mcal/d), the NEL content of milk must be multiplied by the milk production (kg/d). 9.4 Activity Requirements for activity are included in the maintenance requirement. These equations are appropriate for most confinement operations. For grazing operations where animals have substantially greater activity, equations are provided in Chapter 13 (NASEM, 2021). 9.5 Environmental effects The Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle includes equations to predict energy requirements for thermal regulation (i.e., maintaining the body temperature in different environmental conditions). For dairy cattle, the NASEM (2021) committee explained that there was insufficient data to create similar equations for lactating dairy cattle, although they acknowledged that thermal regulation affects energy balance. This probably reflects an important difference between beef and dairy systems: whereas certain beef production systems provide animals extensive outdoor access (e.g., rangeland or feedlot), many U.S. dairy production systems confine cattle to barns that are environmentally controlled. However, the NASEM (2021) model does include equations to adjust energy requirememts for calves due to thermal stress. 9.6 Gestation The energy requirements for gestation are estimated based on the predicted weight of the gravid uterus (uterus + fetus + reproductive tissues) during gestation, and the predicted weight of the uterus as it regresses to non-reproductive state during the first 100 days of lactation (involution). \\[NEGestation = GrUterWtChange * 0.882\\] Where NEGestation is in Mcal/d, and the change in the gravid uterus is in kg of as-is weight per d. During gestation, the maternal and fetal tissues grow and demand energy (positive use). Predicted energy use for gestation also accounts for the involution of maternal reproductive tissues after parturition. As the maternal tissues return to their non-reproductive state, they release some energy that the animal can use (negative use). Details for calculating the uterine weight throughout the first 100 days in lactation are given on p. 32. Test Yourself: The energy use for gestation is positive immediately after parturition (calving). TRUEFALSE 9.7 Body reserve change For lactating cows, the NEL required to gain or lose body reserves is calculated as follows: \\[ NEReserve = 6.3 * BWChange\\] Where the reserve change is in Mcal/d and the BW change is in kg/d, which can be positive (gaining body reserves) or negative (losing body reserves). The animal demands energy from the diet to gain body reserves. On the other hand, mobilizing body reserves releases energy and reduces the need for dietary energy. 9.8 Frame gain The NASEM (2021) committee used the following approach to calculate energy requirements for frame gain. First, they determined the fat and protein content of \"frame gain\" as cattle grow. These are discussed extensively in Chapter 11 (NASEM, 2021). This was important, because the fat and protein content of the animal's body changes as they mature. Based on the protein and fat content, the committee suggested the following equation: \\[\\text{NEFrame} = (9.4*FatADG + 5.55*ProteinADG)\\] Where FrameGainNE is in Mcal/d and FatADG and ProteinADG are the kg of Fat and Protein gained as the animal's frame grows, per day. Frame gain is assumed to always demand energy, because there is no normal situation in which the animal's frame shrinks. This equation is interesting, because its coefficients are fairly similar to the coefficients in the NELactation equation. This suggests that the energy content of major body components (fat, protein) is similar to the energy content of milk components (fat, protein). 9.9 Total energy use The total energy use is predicted as the sum of energy used for maintenance, lactation, gestation, body reserve, and frame. Gestation and body reserves can be positive uses (e.g., energy demand for growing fetus or accumulating body reserves) or negative uses (e.g., energy released by involution of reproductive tissues or mobilization of body reserves). \\[NETotal = NEMaintenance + NELactation + NEGestation + \\\\[16pt] NEReserve + NEFrame\\] Test Yourself: Which of the following body functions is NOT accounted for in the NASEM (2021) energy model? MaintenanceLactationGestationRespirationFrameReserves 9.10 Converting to NEL basis As discussed in the last chapter, ME represents circulating energy that is available to the animal for metabolic purposes. However, ME is not used with perfect efficiency. Instead, some ME energy is lost as heat. Interestingly, experimental work has shown that heat losses associated with ME use/assimilation differ depending on the animal conditions (dry vs. lactating) and the body function the ME is used for (Lactation, Maintenance, Gestation, etc.). This is reviewed extensively in NASEM (2021). Based on past experimental work, NASEM (2021) provides a set of efficiencies for ME to NE conversion for different animal types (Lactating and Dry) as well as different body functions (Lactation, Maintenance, Gestation, Frame, Reserves). These ME to NE conversion efficiencies describe the proportion of ME that can be used as NE (K) versus the proportion lost as heat (1-K). Efficiencies of ME to NE conversion for different body functions Function Parameter Lactating Dry Lactation Kl_ME_NE 0.66 NA Maintenance Km_ME_NE 0.66 0.66 Gestation Ky_ME_NE 0.14 0.14 Frame Kf_ME_NE 0.40 0.40 Reserves Kr_ME_NE 0.74 0.60 NEL is the base unit for energy in NASEM (2021). In other words, energy uses are expressed in relation to the NE used for lactation. This seems to be a source of confusion for many people, but converting between an ME basis and NEL basis is quite simple. For example, let's try converting NEGestation to NEL. First, convert NEGestation back to ME, which is the same across body functions. Doing this requires finding the efficiency of converting NE to ME for gestation using the table above. Then, convert the ME to NEL by using the efficiency of converting ME to NE for lactation in the table above. \\[NEGestation * \\frac{1.00 \\space ME}{0.14 \\space NEGestation}*\\frac{0.66 \\space NEL}{1.00 \\space ME}\\] There is also a way to think about this visually. Looking at the figure below, we can use three rules to calculate any NE \\(\\rightarrow\\) ME or NE \\(\\rightarrow\\) NE conversion we need! Here are the rules: Always start and end at a box. A \"starting box\" is one you have the values for. The \"destination box\" is the value you are trying to determine. These can be ME or NE. To go forwards down an arrow, you must multiply the value in the starting box by the value associated with the arrow. This will give you the value of the destination box. To go backwards down an arrow, you must divide the value in the starting box by the value associated with the arrow. This will give the value in the destination box. This works because of the mathematical relationships between these quantities. If NEL = ME * Kl, we also know that ME = NEL / Kl. The direction of the arrows reminds us which way involves multiplication, and which way involves division by the K coefficient. Figure 9.2: Diagram of ME, conversion efficiencies (K values) and NE for various body functions. Examples: ME to NEFrame. Start at the ME box. Go forward along the Kf arrow. Arrive at the NEFrame box. This process gives the equation: ME * Kf = NEFrame NEFrame to NEL. Start at the NEFrame box. Go backwards along the Kf arrow to arrive at ME. Go forward along the Kl arrow to arrive at NEL. This yields the equation: NEFrame / Kf * Kl = NEL NEReserves to NEL. Start at the NEReserves box. Go backwards along the Kr arrow. Arrive at ME. Then, go forward along the Kl arrow. Arrive at NELactation. This gives the equation: NEReserves / Kr * Kl = NEL NEL to ME. Start at the NEL box. Go backwards along the Kl arrow. Arrive at ME. This gives the equation: NEL / Kl = ME. 9.11 NEL use simulations To get an idea of overall uses, let's compare predicted energy uses for the following scenarios: A dry multiparous cow at 260 days in gestation (dry = not lactating). This cow is anticipated to be gaining a small amount of body reserves (0.1 kg/d). The cow is assumed to be 3+ lactations and no longer growing in frame size. The same multiparous cow, but after starting to lactate, at 30 days in milk (DIM). Her reproductive organs are still involuting. The animal is not accreting body reserves. The same lactating multiparous cow at 150 DIM, mid-lactation, after reaching peak production. The animal is not accreting body reserves. The same lactating multiparous cow at 250 DIM, in late lactation. At this point, she is expected to gain some body reserves (0.1 kg/d) A lactating primiparous cow at 150 DIM that is still growing in frame size. Table 9.1: NEL use for body functions for selected scenarios, Mcal/d Scenario Maintenance Milk Gestation Frame Reserves Dry multiparous, 260 days gestation 13.02 0.00 4.02 0.00 0.72 Lactating multiparous, 30 DIM 13.02 32.67 -0.03 0.00 0.00 Lactating multiparous, 250 DIM 13.02 23.23 0.63 0.00 0.57 Lactating multiparous, 150 DIM 13.02 27.95 0.02 0.00 0.00 Lactating primiparous, 150 DIM 10.57 23.23 0.02 1.38 1.38 Figure 9.3: Predicted net energy of lactation (NEL, Mcal/d) use for different body functions Pause and think What 3-5 main points (about NEL use) would you conclude based on these figures? Write down a few observations. As the figures show, milk production can often be the largest use of NEL for lactating cows, followed by maintenance. Comparatively, frame size and body reserve energy use is relatively minor. Energy use for gestation is also relatively small in these simulations, and is slightly negative during involution of reproductive tissues (30 DIM). 9.12 Questions Explain what factors are involved in calculating maintenance energy use. How would you calculate the energy content of milk (Mcal/kg milk) and the total milk energy output (Mcal/d) using production data?. Describe how energy use is estimated during 1-283 days of gestation, and 1-100 days of lactation. Does the environmental temperature affect predicted energy use in the NASEM model? Explain your answer. How are energy requirements for frame gain different from body reserve gain/loss? Explain the differences in terms of predictive equations. What is the base energy unit in NASEM (2021)? How can net energy values for different body functions be converted to NEL? 9.13 Examples 9.13.1 NASEM dairy-8 Show NASEM dairy-8 example Open NASEM dairy-8.

For example: actin and myosin proteins contract muscles collagen and elastin, proteins in connective tissue, provide structural support protein hormones such as insulin and vasopressin regulate body processes hemoglobin carries oxygen in the blood immunoglobulin proteins (antibodies) participate in the immune response All proteins contain nitrogen, because every amino acid has an amino group (\\(-NH_2\\)). All proteins also contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Some proteins contain sulfur, iron, copper, or other elements. Although every protein contains N, the N content of a given AA or protein varies. Across the animal kingdom, dietary AA absorbed in the small intestine are used to synthesize body proteins and output proteins during translation. In some animals (e.g., ruminants) a microbial community enables more significant use of dietary non-protein nitrogenous compounds for protein synthesis. This is one reason why the nutritional definition of protein is slightly different from its biological definition. Figure 10.2: A. Free amino acids. B. Peptides, which are chains of AA. C. An example protein, which is a large molecule formed by a sequence of ~50 to 2000 AA, and takes on a 3-dimensional structure that can include multiple subunits 10.2 Nutritional definitions of protein In animal nutrition, \"protein\" is defined in more practical, measurable terms. The simplest nutritional term for protein is crude protein (CP). The CP fraction in a feed sample is determined by the laboratory analysis of the total nitrogen (N) content in the sample multiplied by 6.25. \\[ CP = N * 6.25\\] where CP is crude protein expressed in any unit (% of the DM, grams, or g/d for example), N is N content in the same unit, and 6.25 is a conversion factor that assumes that on average 1 g of N is found is 6.25 g of protein.The nutritional definition of protein therefore includes all N-containing compounds. This means that it accounts for both: true protein (TP), which consists of AA; and non-protein nitrogen (NPN) which includes all other nitrogenous compounds that are not AA. NPN includes compounds such as urea, ammonia, nucleotides (in DNA and RNA), and choline. Although these compounds are not protein, they still contain N. The amount of CP is the sum of the amounts of TP and NPN. For many feed and output proteins, the majority of CP is TP. For example, the protein in cow milk is approximately 5% NPN and 95% TP. \\[ CP = TP + NPN \\] In non-ruminant animals, TP is the only usable fraction of CP, and the NPN fraction is of little use. Yet ruminants, or more exactly the microbes that populate the rumen, can use NPN to grow. Through microbial growth processes, some of the NPN in CP are converted into true protein (AA) that the host animal (the cow) can use. Figure 10.3: Examples of N-containing compounds that would be included in CP. A. Urea molecule, an example of NPN. B. Thymine, a nucleic acid which is NPN. C. Lysine, an AA which would be considered TP. NPN Literature Deep Dive In experiments throughout the 1950s and 60s (e.g., Virtanen, 1966), researchers fed cows NPN (e.g. ammonium sulfate, urea) labeled with a stable isotope (\\(^{15}N\\)). By collecting and analyzing milk from these cows, they were able to prove that the same label N from the feed NPN sources appeared later in every type of amino acid found in the cow's milk. In other words, the labeled N from NPN was transformed to amino acids, absorbed by the cow, and incorporated into milk protein. This proved that the microbiota can synthesize (at least to a small extent) every type of AA found in milk protein. Virtanen, A. I. (1966). Milk Production of Cows on Protein-Free Feed: Studies of the use of urea and ammonium salts as the sole nitrogen source open new important perspectives. Science, 153(3744), 1603-1614. Still, it is important to remember that feeding CP with a large fraction of NPN can depress growth and production relative to feeding CP with lesser NPN (and consequently more true protein). Many NPN sources, e.g., urea, are very quickly degraded in the rumen and can cross into the bloodstream as ammonia. Too much ammonia in the blood can be toxic, and even kill animals (ammonia/urea toxicity). For these reasons, protein composition and kinetics need to be carefully managed in the ration. An important limitation built into any CP value is that proteins contain 16% N, which means that in each 100 g of protein, there are 16 g of N. Thus 1 g of N measured in the laboratory corresponds to 6.25 g of protein (100/16). Thus, remember that the N content of a feed will always be 6.25 times lower than its CP content. In reality 16% N in protein is an average obtained across many feed protein sources and N content of proteins actually varies from 13 to 19%, which should equate to variable conversion factors ranging from 5.26 to 7.69 (FAO, 2003). One notable exception for us as nutritionists interested in milk production, is that N content of milk CP contains 15.77% N. Thus the N to CP conversion factor is 100/15.77 = 6.34 (NASEM, 2021). Another consequence of the assumptions made in calculating CP is that some feed may have a CP value greater than 100%! For example, feed grade urea, which can be used in dairy rations as a source of NPN, typically contains 46% N. Following the 6.25 rule, the CP of urea is 287%. Although CP is not a perfect measure of protein per se, it provides a common and measurable starting point for nutritional models. CP can be determined through a standardized and simple laboratory technique, which makes it practical for large-scale use across many feeds and farms. The NASEM model discusses the CP, TP, and NPN contents not just of feeds, but also of other quantities (e.g., microbial protein, feces, urine), so these definitions will be important to remember.

In general terms, goals in protein and nitrogen nutrition in dairy cattle include: manage the kinetics of ruminal N degradation and N recycling to support microbial protein synthesis. supply adequate amounts of amino acids (AA) to the small intestine to meet animal needs. reduce losses of N in manure. For lactating dairy cattle, optimizing milk protein output is a central goal. Milk protein supplies 20% of the protein consumed by American people (NHANES, 2010), making it important for human nutrition. The dairy industry also supplies 21% of the beef consumed in the U.S. (Moreira et al., 2021). Although milk and meat production is important to human nutrition domestically, it is arguably more critical in developing countries where protein and energy undernutrition is more common (FAO, 2018). Manure N is part of a naturally-occurring N cycle. However, excess manure N is an environmental concern because of its potential contribution to water quality degradation (nitrate in drinking water for example) and because of its contribution to air quality degradation (emission of ammonia, which can perturb the balance of natural ecosystem, and emission of nitrous oxide, which is a very potent greenhouse gas contributing to climate change). Therefore, feeding the human population must be balanced with stewardship of the environment. Test Yourself: 1. Which of the following is a goal of protein and nitrogen nutrition in dairy cattle? Promote ruminal N degradationMaximize losses of N in manureOptimize productivity 1. Which GHG is produced as a result of the N cycle? CO2NH3NO2N2N2O 10.4 The animal protein system In the subsequent activities, we will explore the animal protein system. Recalling from previous chapters (Systems Concepts), the animal's protein system involves input, output, and transformation flows. The system includes a core sequence of nutritional processes (ingestion, digestion, absorption, assimilation/use). Protein models describe these features with respect to protein and protein-related nutrients. Ingestion (as Crude Protein) Rumen degradation (as Rumen-Degraded Protein) and passage (as Rumen-Undegraded Protein) and microbial protein synthesis Intestinal digestion; absorption to circulation (as Metabolizable Protein) Assimilation and/or use (as Net Protein) for output flows such as milk protein and maintenance proteins (in hair, hooves, and digestive tract) and transformation flows such as body reserve gain Figure 10.4: Depiction of protein flows in ruminant animals. Figure shows how protein proceeds through the digestive tract, NPN and AA are absorbed into circulation, and NPN and AA in circulation follow various paths. As the figure illustrates, protein flows in the animal are quite complex. The NASEM (2021) model does not depict every mechanism in detail. Instead, it focuses on some major areas that are most nutritionally-relevant. For example, significant transformations in the rumen affect the AA composition of protein available to the animal, so ruminal protein degradation and passage are modeled in great detail. It is also critical to know how much AA reach circulation (metabolizable protein), because these are the AA the animal can use to meet bodily needs. Finally, NASEM (2021) offers some predictions of the net protein needed by the animal for body functions. Each of these areas will be discussed in greater detail in later chapters. 10.5 Amino acids Historically, diets were formulated on a protein basis. However, physiologically, animals require individual AA, not protein per se. There are 20 common AAs that occur in proteins. Of these, nine are classified as essential (EAA) and one as conditionally essential. EAA are essential because their carbon skeletons cannot be synthesized by animal cells at a rate that meets metabolic needs. In contrast, Non-essential AA (NEAA) can be synthesized by animal cells in large enough quantities to supply needs. The term \"conditionally essential\" refers to an AA that is essential under certain conditions. Dairy cattle can synthesize Arg in large quantities, but Arg synthesis is not enough to meet Arg demands when milk production is high. Therefore, whether or not Arg is \"essential\" depends on the conditions. Early studies pointed to Lys and Met as the the most limiting AA for milk production when preserved forages were included in the TMR. The previous edition of 'Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle' (NRC, 2001) included recommendations for the percentage of metabolizable protein that should come from these two AA. This approach had limitations. First, it did not include many other AA that affected production. Second, because AA recommendations were given as a percentage of MP (rather than g/d), it described the AA \"profile\" rather than the specific amount supplied of each individual EAA. Between 2001 and 2021, significant research efforts were dedicated to expanding knowledge of AA flows in dairy cattle. As a result, supplies of all essential AA (EAA; g/d) are modeled in NASEM (2021). EAA Abbreviation Histidine His Isoleucine Ile Leucine Leu Lysine Lys Methionine Met Phenylalanine Phe Threonine Thr Tryptophan Trp Valine Val Arginine Arg Test Yourself: True or False: Animals require individual amino acids (AA) rather than protein itself. TRUEFALSE. True or False: Non-essential amino acids (NEAA) can be synthesized by animal cells in large enough quantities to supply needs. TRUEFALSE. How many essential amino acids (EAA) are there? 691012. Which AA is conditionally essential for dairy cattle? LeuValIsoArg. Which AA were included in the previous NRC (2001) model? Lys and MetLys and LeuHis and Met. What about recycling? Although the NASEM model describes most protein input, output, and transformation flows, it does not explicitly describe some of the circularity inherent in actual protein flows. We can consider two examples: First, in ruminants, circulating urea is recycled to the gastrointestinal tract. Urea that re-enters the rumen can contribute to microbial protein supply. This mechanism is not depicted in the NASEM (2021) model explicitly. Second, in dairy cattle (as in many other mammals), body protein is continually turning over. In fact, the rate of turnover is greater than rates of inputs and outputs. For example, a lactating dairy cow may consume 2.0 kg of apparently-digestible protein, and export 1.0-1.5 kg of milk protein per day, but degrade 3.0 kg of body protein and synthesize in excess of 4.0 kg of protein per day (Lobley, 2003). By mass, the empty body (subtracting weight of digesta) of a dairy cow contains ~ 8-11% protein on an as-is basis (NASEM, 2021). This means that a 700 kg lactating Holstein with 506 kg empty body weight would have 40-55 kg of body protein (Yan et al., 2009). The constant turnover of body protein (sometimes called \"remodeling\") offers animals flexibility to continually alter structure and/or function of body tissues. It also makes the animal more resilient to varying diet composition. For example, the animal can tolerate some day-to-day imbalances or insufficiencies in dietary AA because it can also draw upon body reserve AAs. However, regular body protein turnover (recycling) does not represent a net input, output, or change to the animal's status. Therefore, it is excluded from the NASEM model.

Learning Objectives Define RDP and RUP. Explain the possible fates of protein that enters the rumen. Describe experimental methods for determining protein kinetics. Calculate CP, RDP, and RUP for a given feed, and for a diet using NASEM (2021) equations. In the last chapter, we learned basic biological and nutritional definitions of protein. Next, we will discuss how protein nutrition is modeled in dairy cattle. As a first step, this chapter discusses how CP ingested by the animal is transformed in the rumen. Rumen physiology has been studied for centuries. However, we will learn how experimental methods developed in the last half-century influenced thinking about ruminal protein kinetics. Additionally, we will practice with NASEM (2021) equations to illustrate a modern modeling choice. 11.1 CP intake CP is a low cost, routine feed analysis that is done on almost all samples sent to commercial laboratories. NASEM (2021) Feed Tables have default values for CP content of many different types of feeds. Notice that fats and vitamins/minerals provide no CP. Figure 11.2: Crude protein (% of DM; Mean ± SD) of selected feeds in the NASEM library CP Intake: Feed-level calculations Calculating an animal's intake of a certain nutrient from a certain ingredient involves multiplying the DMI of that ingredient by the CP composition (DM basis) of that feed ingredient. This can be done for any protein fraction given in the NASEM Feed Tables. Given information: CP content of corn grain = 8% DMI of corn grain = 5 kg CP Intake from Corn Grain = (8 kg CP/100 kg DM) * 5 kg DM = 0.4 kg CP intake from corn grain This example can be done individually for each ingredient. Or, it can be done by multiplying two vectors: a vector of CP contents and a vector of DMI, which each should be as long as the number of feeds (\\(n\\)) in the diet. CP Intake: Diet-level calculations We can perform a similar operation at the diet level, across all ingredients. This relates to the weighted sum discussed previously (Machinery chapter). \\[\\text{Diet CP Intake}= \\sum_{i = 1}^{n \\space feeds} w_iCP_i \\] \\(w_i\\) is the DMI of feed \\(i\\) in kg \\(CP_i\\) is the CP content of feed \\(i\\) as a percent (kg CP / 100 kg DM) 11.2 Ruminal protein supplies In ruminants, dietary protein undergoes significant transformations in the rumen that affect its nutritive properties. For this reason, all dairy nutrition models include some description of protein degradation or passage through the rumen, and microbial protein synthesis. In general, the majority of dietary protein in the diet of a lactating cow will be RDP (55 to 75% of CP) and a lesser fraction will be RUP (25 to 45% of CP). This often means that half or more of the cow's protein nutritional needs are often met by microbial protein supply. 11.2.1 RDP and RUP Protein systems such as NASEM break down CP intake in two fractions: the fraction degraded by the rumen microbes (RDP) and the fraction that escapes rumen degradation (RUP). Both RDP and RUP contribute to the supply of AA at the small intestine, but in different ways. The microbes used the RDP as a source of N to grow, producing microbial protein with a different AA composition than the RDP. In contrast, RUP passes through the rumen intact, without microbes altering the AA composition. Then, microbial protein and RUP are both digested with mammalian enzymes in the abomasum and small intestine. \\[ CP = RDP + RUP \\] CP that enters the rumen has only two possible fates: it will either be degraded (RDP) or pass out of the rumen (RUP). At this point we have reached a question. How do we know how much protein will be degraded in the rumen, and how much protein will pass through the rumen? Many nutritional models (including NASEM) address this problem by modeling the kinetics of ruminal protein degradation and passage for each feed. In other words, they model the rates (amount / time) of intake, degradation, and passage to determine the fates of CP intake (RDP or RUP). K is the generic term used to denote a \"rate.\" Because there is one input and only two possible outputs, the rate of intake (Kd + Kp) is equal to the rate of degradation (Kd) plus the rate of passage (Kp). This is due to the conservation of mass: what goes in, must come out, so over time the inputs = outputs. Figure 11.3: Diagram of the rumen protein system, showing that CP intake can flow through two possible fates: degradation or passage. Rates of Degradation (kd, %/h) One of the first ways nutrition researchers tried to determine protein degradation kinetics was through in situ (translation: on site) studies of protein degradation. In these studies, researchers placed a small mass of feed (0.3 to 12 g) inside a porous bag. Then, they lowered these bags into the rumen of a cannulated cow. In theory, the pores of the bag are large enough for microbes and rumen fluid to flow in, but not large enough for undigested feed particles to flow out. By taking bags out every several hours, they could measure how much protein had disappeared from the bag at a given time. With the proper setup, the disappearance rate from the bag tells the digestion rate at any given time. In the 1970s, researchers in Aberdeen, U.K. proposed a way of thinking about ruminal protein disappearance that is still used today. In a study using in situ techniques, 0rskov and McDonald (1979) took repeated observations of the amount of protein remaining in the rumen for a given feed. Graphically, their observations looked something like this: Figure 11.4: Ruminal protein degradation kinetics, unlabeled. Pause and think What would you conclude about ruminal protein kinetics based on this figure? From these observations, 0rskov and McDonald (1979) decided that CP entering the rumen seemed to behave in three main ways: \"there exists one protein fraction (A; % total protein) which disappears very rapidly from the rumen, and...a second protein fraction (B; % total protein) disappears at a constant fractional rate...with some protein supplements there is clearly a third protein fraction which does not disappear over the period of observations (C; % total protein)\" In other words, these researchers decided to categorize ruminal protein fractions into three parts based on their rates of degradation. In equation form the amounts of CP (% of DM) can be expressed: \\[CP = A + B + C\\] Figure 11.5: Ruminal protein degradation kinetics. Shows the fraction degraded instantaneously, a fraction degraded at a moderate rate, and a fraction where no degradation occurs. The discovery of 0rskov and McDonald (1979) suggested that the rate of degradation was infinitely fast for the A portion of CP (Kd = \\(\\infty\\) %/h), the rate of degradation was basically zero for the C portion of CP (Kd = 0 %/h), and the rate of degradation for the B portion of CP was somewhere in between (Kd = 0 to \\(\\infty\\) %/h). This conceptual framework was later used in the development of the NRC (2001) and NASEM (2021) models, with a few modifications. Test Yourself Which of these equations is NOT correct? CP = TP + NPNCP = Kd + KpCP = RDP + RUPCP = A + B + C The ABC fraction is degraded at a moderate rate. The ABC fraction is degraded instantaneously. The ABC fraction is never degraded. Relation to carbohydrate nutrition It is important to remember that the microbial population requires both N and carbohydrates to grow and reproduce. Similar to the quickly-degrading, moderately-fast degrading, and slow-degrading fractions of protein, carbohydrates also vary in their rates of ruminal degradation. Glucose and other simple sugars are rapidly degraded, starch (depending on its processing) is moderately-quickly degraded, and fiber (NDF) is more slowly degraded. Rates of Passage (kp, %/h) In in situ studies, researchers can keep a bag of feed particles inside the rumen for many days, until all potentially rumen-degradable material has disappeared (i.e., the rate of passage is zero). However, in reality, feed particles are constantly passing out of the rumen to the lower gastrointestinal tract. This means that some potentially rumen-degradable material flows out of the rumen before it can be degraded. To learn about rates of passage, researchers have used labeled ingredients. Certain elements (e.g., Cr, Co, Yb) are not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and appear to have limited effects on the function of the animal and microbiota. Because these elements pass through the animal without being absorbed, they can be used to determine the rate of passage of digesta at various locations along the digestive tract. It is also possible to ascertain the rate of passage of N specifically (as opposed to ALL digesta) by \"labeling\" feeds with a stable N isotope. Competition between Degradation and Passage In the NASEM model, the fractions of CP that are RDP and RUP depend on the competition between rate of degradation (Kd, %/h and rate of passage (Kp, %/h) from the rumen. The slower the rate of passage is, the greater the period of time a feed spends in the rumen, the greater the period of time available for microbial action, and the greater the extent of degradation of the protein. Example Using a simple example, if Kd is 4%/h and Kp is 8%/h, then the proportion of the B fraction degraded in the rumen is: 4 / (4 + 8) = 0.33 (or 33%) and the proportion of the B fraction that escapes ruminal degradation is: 8 / (4 = 8) = 0.66 (or 66%) Note that the sum of Kd and Kp provides an estimate of the rate of disappearance of the B fraction from the rumen. In our example, the rate of disappearance of the B fraction is 12%/h (8%/h due to passage from the rumen plus 4%/h due to the degradation by rumen microbes). The first step in calculating RDP and RUP is gathering information about each feed in the diet. The Feed Tables in NASEM (2021) provide parameters for each specific feed ingredient. For example, alfalfa haylage has an entry containing the following information: Crude protein (% of DM) The NPN content (% of CP), all of which is assumed to belong to the A fraction The A fraction (% of CP) The B fraction (% of CP) The C fraction (% of CP) Rate of degradation (Kd, %/h) The rates of passage (Kp, %/h) are given in the Protein chapter. There is one Kp for forages (4.87 %/h) and one for concentrate feeds (%/h). Figure 11.6: Degradation kinetics for the B fraction in four selected feeds from the NASEM (2021) library. Two are concentrates (soybean meal and wheat grain) and two are forages (corn silage and legume silage). Grey boxes show the fractions of CP instantaneously degraded and passing. feed A B C Kd Kp RUP RDP Wheat grain 31 54 15 0.19100 0.0528 28.702 71.298 Corn silage, typical 60 24 16 0.04068 0.0487 32.920 67.080 Legume silage, mid-maturity 52 39 9 0.08174 0.0487 26.875 73.125 Soybean meal, solvent 48CP 18 80 2 0.09000 0.0528 32.752 67.248 11.2.2 Calculating RDP and RUP Now we have all the information needed to calculate the percentage or amount of CP that will become RDP versus RUP. Figure 11.7: Partitioning of CP into A, B, C, and sub-fractions We start by dividing the quickly-degrading A fraction into TP and NPN. Often, the A fraction is 100% TP. \\[A = NPN + TPA\\] NASEM (2021) states that 100% of NPN is RDP, and none is RUP. We do not use kinetic parameters (Kd and Kp) for the NPN fraction because it is assumed to be degraded instantaneously. \\[\\text{RDP from NPN} = NPN\\] \\[\\text{RUP from NPN} = 0\\] Then, we can find the RDP contributed by the TP in the A fraction. NASEM (2021) states that most (93.6%) the TPA fraction is part of the RDP except for a small part (6.4%) that is RUP. We do not use kinetic parameters (Kd and Kp) for the TPA fraction because it is assumed to be degraded instantaneously. \\[\\text{RDP from TPA} = TPA * (1-0.064)\\] \\[\\text{RUP from TPA} = TPA * 0.064\\] The B fraction is slightly more complex, because the competition between the rate of degradation (Kd) and rate of passage (Kp) determines the proportion of B that becomes RDP and the proportion that becomes RUP. The total rate of disappearance is the sum of the rate of degradation and the rate of passage (Kd + Kp). We can calculate the partial rates of disappearance for degradation (\\(\\frac{Kd}{(Kd+Kp)}\\)) and for passage (\\(\\frac{Kp}{(Kd+Kp)}\\)). Multiplying the B fraction by these partial rates of disappearance gives us the proportion of B fraction degraded in the rumen, which can contribute to microbial growth: \\[\\text{RDP from B} = B*\\frac{Kd}{(Kd+Kp)}\\] and the proportion of the B fraction not degraded in the rumen: \\[\\text{RUP from B} = B*\\frac{Kp}{(Kd+Kp)}\\] The C fraction is extremely simple! It is assumed to be 0% degradable and 100% undegradable. In equation form, this means: \\[\\text{RDP from C} = 0\\] \\[\\text{RUP from C} = C\\] The CP (% or amount) that is rumen-degradable is calculated as the sum of the degraded A and degraded B fractions. This is because RDP from C is always equal to zero. \\[ \\text{Total RDP} = (\\text{RDP from A}) + (\\text{RDP from B})\\] The CP (% or amount) that is RUP is calculated by summing the amount of undegraded A and undegraded B fraction protein with the C fraction. This is because the C fraction is 100% undegradable, so all of it contributes to RUP. \\[ \\text{Total RUP} = (\\text{RUP from A}) + (\\text{RUP from B})+(\\text{RUP from C})\\] Figure 11.8: Summary of NASEM scheme for calculating RDP and RUP. The details summarized in this figure are listed in the text above. Example: Calculating RDP and RUP for a single feed. We can start by calculating RDP and RUP for a single feed (legume silage, mid-maturity). Assume 10 kg of this feed (DM basis) are consumed. Animal Information DMI of just this feed, kg = 10 Feed Table Values (NASEM, 2021, p. 380) CP, % of DM = 20.5 NPN, % of CP = 0 A fraction, % of CP = 52 B fraction, % of CP = 39 C fraction, % of CP = 9 Kd of B, %/h = 8.2 Ch. 6 Values Kp of forage, %/h = 4.87 Show problem set-up Often, our end goal is to get the amounts of RDP and RUP (kg CP). We can start by calculating the CP intake: CP Intake (kg DM) = 10 kg DMI * (20.5% CP in DM) = 2.05 kg CP Then, we can calculate the amounts of NPN, A, B, and C fractions: NPN = 2.05 kg CP * (0 kg NPN/ 100 kg CP) = 0 kg NPN A = 2.05 kg CP * (52 kg A/100 kg CP) = 1.07 kg A B = 2.05 kg CP * (39 kg B/100 kg CP) = 0.80 kg B C = 2.05 kg CP * (9 kg C/100 kg CP) = 0.18 kg C At this point, we can see that 52+39+9 accounts for 100% of CP, and as a consequence, that 1.07+.80+.18 accounts for all 2.05 kg of CP being fed. Next, we subtract any diet NPN from the A fraction to split it into true protein (TPA) and non-protein (NPN) fractions. TPA (kg) = A - NPN = 1.07 - 0 = 1.07 kg NPN in A = 0 kg Show RDP calculation Next, we can calculate the RDP from the A fraction. RDP from A = NPN + 93.6*TPA RDP from A = 0 + (93.6 kg A degraded/100 kg A intake)1.07 kg TPA intake RDP from A = 1.00 kg Then, the RDP from the B fraction: RDP from B = (8.2 / (8.2+4.87)) * 0.80 kg B intake RDP from B = 0.50 kg And the total RDP: RDP total = (RDP from A) + (RDP from B) RDP total = 1.5 kg Show RUP calculation There is no RDP from C, so we can move to RUP. We have a few options. We can calculate RUP by difference, because we know CP = RDP + RUP and we have both CP and RDP values. We can also calculate RUP step by step. The latter approach is shown below. First, we calculate RUP from A: RUP from A = (6.4 kg A passing/100 kg A intake)1.07 kg TPA intake RUP from A = 0.07 kg Then, the RUP from B: RUP from B = (4.87 / (8.2+4.87)) * 0.80 kg B intake RUP from B = 0.30 kg And the RUP from C: RUP from C = (100 kg C passage/100 kg C intake) * C RUP from C = 10.18 kg RUP from C = 0.18 kg RUP total = (RUP from A) + (RUP from B) + (RUP from C) RUP total = 0.07 + 0.30 + 0.18 RUP total = 0.55 We can check again that the RDP + RUP sums to the total amount of CP (within rounding error). CP = RDP + RUP CP = 1.5 + 0.55 CP = 2.05 kg The RDP and RUP can also be expressed as a percent of CP, rather than an amount in kg. Here, 1.5/2.55 gives 73% of CP as RDP, and 27% of CP as RUP. To do this at the diet level (rather than for an individual feed) we can calculate RDP and RUP for each ingredient in the diet, using the intake of that particular feed ingredient, and sum them.

CP = RDP + RUP CP = 1.75 + 0.85 CP \\(\\approx\\) 2.6 kg 11.2.3 Microbial protein synthesis The next step modeled in the rumen in microbial protein synthesis. Microbial protein synthesis is described as a saturable growth process dependent on available RDP and major rumen-degradable carbohydrates (RDNDF = rumen-degradable neutral detergent fiber, and RDS = rumen-degradable starch). Note that the equation predicts microbial N, which can easily be converted to CP. Eq. 6-3, p. 74 (NASEM, 2021) \\[ \\text{Microbial N (g/d)} = \\frac{\\beta_0 + (\\beta_1 * RDP)}{(1 + \\frac{\\beta_2}{RDNDF})(1 + \\frac{\\beta_3}{RDS})} \\] Note that in most of the equations we have seen so far, the coefficients have been numbers, not symbols. In this equation, NASEM (2021) lists coefficients (\\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3\\)) separately in the text. The equation can be rewritten with the coefficients replaced with their respective values. Eq. 6-3 is a Michaelis-Menten function. It suggests that both rumen-fermentable carbohydrates and rumen-degradable protein contribute to microbial protein synthesis. The numerator includes a constant and the maximum velocity of microbial N production in g per day. \\(V_m = \\beta_0 + (\\beta_1 * RDP)\\). Terms in the denominator represent the Michaelis constants (\\(K_m\\)) for major pools of rumen-degradable carbohydrates: \\(\\beta_2 = K_m\\) for RDNDF \\(\\beta_2 = K_m\\) for RDS. Details on calculating RDNDF and RDS are given in the consensus report (NASEM, 2021, p. 74). Figure 11.9: Microbial N synthesis at varying supplies of RDNDF (kg/d), RDS (kg/d), RDP (kg/d) This figure uses values that are more extreme than those seen in typical diets, for illustration purposes. In it, we can see that low supply of either RDNDF or RDS depresses the effect of RDP on microbial N synthesis. The effect of RDNDF is more drastic because its coefficient is larger. Next, we can determine how much of the microbial CP is TP versus NPN. NASEM (2021) assumes that a fixed percentage (82.4%) of microbial CP is TP, and the remainder is NPN. This is because the \"bodies\" of the microbes contain not just AA and true protein, but also NPN such as the nucleic acids in microbial DNA and RNA. Microbial TP can contribute to metabolizable protein, whereas microbial NPN does not. Instead. microbial NPN is assumed to be excreted in urine. NASEM (2021) assumes that excess N not used in bodily functions is excreted in urine to preserve the mass balance of N inputs and outputs. \\[ \\text{Microbial TP (g/d)} = (\\text{Microbial CP (g/d)})*0.824 \\] Test Yourself Convert microbial N to microbial CP.

Learning Objectives Define MP. Describe how the fractions of digested microbial TP and RUP are calculated. Explain how to convert RUP and microbial TP supplies to an AA basis. In the last chapter, we determined what fractions of protein were degraded and potentially contributed to microbial TP. We also learned that some protein passes out of the rumen without being altered by microbes. In this chapter, we will resume where we left off: with microbial TP and RUP exiting the rumen and entering the lower gastrointestinal tract where they can be digested and absorbed. In other words, the goal of this chapter is to move from rumen protein fractions to metabolizable protein and AA. 12.1 Digestion of microbial TP Microbial TP is assumed to be 80% digestible (NASEM, 2021). \\[\\text{digestible MiTP (g/d)} = 0.80* \\text{MiTP (g/d)}\\] Test Yourself: True or false: The digestibility of microbial TP depends on the feeds in the diet. TRUEFALSE 12.2 Digestion of RUP Each feed has its own intestinal digestibility coefficient (dRUP) listed in the Feed Tables. To calculate the amount of digestible RUP for a certain feed, multiply the feed's digestibility coefficient (\\(dcRUP_i\\)) by the RUP intake from that feed (\\(RUPIn_i\\)). All of digestible RUP is assumed to be TP. \\[\\text{digestible RUP (g/d) from feed }i = {dcRUP_i} * RUPIn_i\\] The digestible RUP from each feed can be summed to create a diet-level digestible RUP. \\[\\text{Diet digestible RUP}= \\sum_{i = 1}^{n \\space feeds} ({dcRUP_i} * RUPIn_i) \\] where: \\(dcRUP_i\\) is the RUP digestibility coefficient (g RUP digested / 100 g RUP supply) \\(RUPIn_i\\) is the RUP supply from feed \\(i\\) in g/d Feed dcRUP Wheat grain 87.734 Corn silage, typical 70.000 Legume silage, mid-maturity 70.000 Soybean meal, solvent 48CP 91.000 12.3 Metabolizable protein The true protein digested postruminally is absorbed as AA that reach the blood stream (portal vein) for transport to the liver. This pool of AA circulating in the blood is called Metabolizable Protein (MP). Thus similar to the metabolizable energy concept, MP refers to the \"useful\" nutrients (in this case AA) absorbed in the blood. MP is the sum of digestible RUP and digestible microbial TP. \\[\\text{MP (g/d)} = (\\text{digestible MiTP (g/d)}) + (\\text{digestible RUP (g/d)})\\] 12.4 AA basis According to the NASEM (2021) committee, although MP should be used to describe and assess diets, it is intestinally-absorbed AAs (rather than protein) that are metabolized. In other words, the nutrients used by tissues are AA, not protein. 12.5 AA in microbial protein Figure 12.2: Essential amino acid profile (% of true protein) of microbial true protein in NASEM (2021, p. 79). 12.6 AA in RUP The EAA composition of RUP is assumed to be the same as the EAA composition of CP in the feed ingredient. Therefore, to convert RUP to an AA basis, we can multiply the RUP (g/d) by the EAA composition of the feed. \\[ \\text{RUPEAA, g/d} = \\text{RUP, g/d} * \\begin{bmatrix} \\text{Arg % of CP} \\\\ \\text{His % of CP} \\\\ \\text{Ile % of CP} \\\\ \\text{Leu % of CP} \\\\ \\text{Lys % of CP} \\\\ \\text{Met % of CP} \\\\ \\text{Phe % of CP} \\\\ \\text{Thr % of CP} \\\\ \\text{Trp % of CP} \\\\ \\text{Val % of CP} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] Figure 12.3: Essential amino acid (EAA, % of true protein) composition of selected feeds from the NASEM (2021) feed tables, which is equivalent to the EAA composition of rumen undegraded protein from these feeds. NASEM (2021) assumed that the digestibility of each individual AA in RUP was the same as the digestibility of RUP (p. 78). The committee noted that this assumption is likely incorrect, but they had insufficient data to recommend digestibility coefficients for each individual AA. For a given feed, the digested fraction of each EAA can be calculated using the digestibility coefficient of RUP for that feed (\\(dcRUP\\)) multiplied by the total supply of each EAA in RUP supply. In the NASEM (2021) model, these AA supplies are corrected for incomplete recovery during hydrolysis to correct for errors introduced by laboratory methods. This aspect is omitted from our interactive textbook. \\[ \\text{dRUPEAA, g/d} = dcRUP * \\begin{bmatrix} \\text{Arg, g/d} \\\\ \\text{His, g/d} \\\\ \\text{Ile, g/d} \\\\ \\text{Leu, g/d} \\\\ \\text{Lys, g/d} \\\\ \\text{Met, g/d} \\\\ \\text{Phe, g/d} \\\\ \\text{Thr, g/d} \\\\ \\text{Trp, g/d} \\\\ \\text{Val, g/d} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] Test Yourself: True or false: The digestibility of each individual AA in RUP is assumed to be the same as the overall digestibility of RUP. TRUEFALSE True or false: In many feeds, only a small portion (10-20%) of RUP is digestible. TRUEFALSE 12.7 Examples Show NASEM dairy-8 Example Open NASEM dairy-8.

Learning Objectives Define NP. List the protein demands (e.g., scurf, lactation) considered by the NASEM (2021) model Explain what happens to protein in excess of body uses In the last chapter, we followed protein transformations through digestion and absorption. By the end of the last chapter, we knew the AA supplies (g/d) entering circulation and available as metabolizable protein (MP). In this chapter, we will focus on how circulating AA are used by various body tissues, for body functions. Protein used in body tissues (export or constitutive proteins) is referred to as net protein (NP). This is mostly analogous to the energy fractionation scheme. Similar to how energy is conserved, we can recall from the Systems Concepts chapter that the mass of the element N will also be conserved across nutritional processes. The NASEM (2021) model includes predictions of NP use for several body functions. First, there are baseline body functions that demand protein even for animals that are not \"performing\" (lactating, gestating, or growing). These functions are collectively referred to as \"maintenance\" uses. Maintenance uses include endogenous urinary, metabolic fecal, and scurf protein use. In contrast, pregnancy, lactation, and growth can be considered \"productive\" uses. To get an idea of overall uses, let's compare predicted protein uses for the scenarios discussed in the last chapter: A dry multiparous cow at 260 days in gestation (dry = not lactating). This cow is anticipated to be gaining a small amount of body reserves (0.1 kg/d). The cow is assumed to be 3+ lactations and no longer growing in frame size. The same multiparous cow, but after starting to lactate, at 30 days in milk (DIM). Her reproductive organs are still involuting. The animal is not accreting body protein reserves. The same lactating multiparous cow at 150 DIM, mid-lactation, after reaching peak production. The animal is not accreting body protein reserves. The same lactating multiparous cow at 250 DIM, in late lactation. At this point, she is expected to gain some body reserves (0.1 kg/d) A lactating primiparous cow at 150 DIM that is still growing in frame size. Simulated Conditions Use Dry multiparous, 260 days gestation Lactating multiparous, 30 DIM Lactating multiparous, 250 DIM Lactating multiparous, 150 DIM Lactating primiparous, 150 DIM Scurf 8 8 8 8 7 Endogenous Urinary 219 219 219 219 166 Metabolic Fecal 171 320 290 283 240 Frame Growth 0 0 0 0 25 Body Reserves 6 0 6 0 0 Pregnancy 95 -5 15 1 1 Lactation 0 1395 992 1194 992 Figure 13.2: Predicted net protein use for different body functions Pause and think What 3-5 main points (about protein use) would you conclude based on this table and figures? Write down a few observations. Pulling out a few examples, we can make some observations. Every scenario demands protein for maintenance functions: scurf, endogenous urinary, and metabolic fecal protein use. However, some scenarios have predicted uses that equal zero. For example, the protein used for Frame Growth = 0 for the multiparous cow because this scenario assumed an animal with 3+ lactations that was no longer growing. The protein requirement for body reserves is zero for the scenarios at 30 and 150 DIM, because these scenarios assume the cow is maintaining a similar body reserve status. The total requirement for protein is drastically lower for non-lactating animals, although the pregnancy requirement is more substantial in late gestation (Dry cow scenario). These scenarios show that the total predicted protein use varies depending on the animal's productive status and life stage. 13.1 Scurf Scurf protein includes skin, hair, and hooves. The animal continually sheds some of this protein into the environment, although it is a small amount compared to other export proteins (e.g., milk protein). The requirements for scurf net protein and AA were determined based on experiments in the mid-1960s by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In these experiments, they measured the composition of the head, hide, feet, and tail of cattle. Based on these results, NASEM (2021) recommended an equations for predicting scurf requirements based on bodyweight. \\[\\text{NPScurf (g/d)} = 0.20 * BW^{0.60} * 0.85\\] This equation uses an allometric scaling of BW (\\(BW^{0.60}\\)) multiplied by a fixed coefficient (0.20). Scurf is assumed to contain 85% TP based on its AA composition. The implication of this equation is that animals with greater bodyweight (i.e., bigger animals) require more scurf protein because they have more protein being lost to maintain their skin, hair, and hooves. Probably, scurf requirements vary depending on the environmental conditions. For example, cattle may need more scurf protein during winter to build up the thick hair coat. However, these differences are so minor compared to other protein requirements that they are ignored in the NASEM (2021) model. 13.2 Endogenous urinary protein NASEM (2021) lists major contributors to endogenous urinary N as endogenous urea, endogenous purine derivatives, creatinine and creatine, hippuric acid, and 3-methyl histidine. These compounds are produced as an unavoidable part of maintaining the animal's function and regular protein turnover. \\[\\text{NPEndUrinary (g/d)} = 53*6.25*BW*0.001\\] This equation uses a relationship found in past research, that 53 mg of endogenous N were excreted in urine per kg of bodyweight. The equation includes a conversion to CP basis (x6.25) and to grams from mg (x0.001). Because endogenous urinary N derives from AA, NASEM (2021) assumed that the ratio of TP to CP was 1.0. Therefore a TP to CP conversion factor is not included in the equation. 13.3 Metabolic fecal protein Metabolic fecal protein represents the endogenous proteins \"secreted or sloughed in the gut lumen and not digested in the small intestine\" (NASEM, 2021; p. 85). In other words, these are proteins produced as part of regular gastrointestinal tract functions that exit the animal (in feces) before being reabsorbed. Eq. 6-9, p. 85 \\[\\text{NPMFP (g/d)} = [(11.62 + 0.134*NDF)*DMI]*0.73\\] where \\(NDF\\) is the percent of NDF in DM (not divided by 100 in this case), and \\(DMI\\) is in kg/d. The MFP fraction is assumed to contain 73% TP. This equation suggests that diets with more fiber (greater NDF%) and greater DMI intake contribute to larger use of protein for metabolic fecal protein. This is because each of these terms has a positive coefficient. 13.4 Milk protein Milk protein export is commonly measured. The net protein requirement for milk production is assumed to be the net protein amount of milk exported. For example, production of 35 kg/d of milk with 3.2% true protein accounts for 1.12 kg of milk net protein secretion (1120 g). Because milk protein production is commonly known, often there is no need for a predictive equation such as those used with other protein uses (e.g., gestation, metabolic fecal protein) 13.5 Gestation protein During gestation, the fetus and placenta grow and demand protein. Maternal reproductive tissues (e.g., the uterus) also grow and demand protein. For this reason, the NASEM (2021) model uses the total gain of the gravid uterus (pregnant uterus) to estimate requirements. Eq. 6-11, p. 86 \\[\\text{NPGestation (g/d)} = Gain_{GrUter} * 125\\] \\(Gain_{GrUter}\\) is the daily gain in mass (as-is) of the gravid uterus. The gravid uterus is assumed to contain 125 g of protein per kg of wet weight. The NASEM (2021) model also assumes that some NP is released by the involution of maternal reproductive tissues. In other words, the process of shrinking the maternal reproductive organs back down to non-pregnant state frees some AA that can be used for other body purposes. This is why the NP use for gestation is negative from days 0 to 100 of lactation. Figure 13.3: Example of NP use for gestation for a cow with conception at 90 days in milk. 13.6 Growth NASEM (2021) divides body growth into two categories: frame growth and body reserve gain. Whereas frame growth is true growth in the size (frame) of a maturing animal, body reserve gain represents changes to body stores including muscle and adipose tissue. The growth requirement is the sum of frame growth and body reserve gain needs. \\[\\text{NPGrowth (g/d)} = (\\text{NP frame gain} )+(\\text{NP reserve gain} )\\] Frame growth Chapter 11 of NASEM (2021, p. 255) discusses growth in much greater detail, including a description of how body composition changes as the animal grows closer to mature body weight. Protein requirements for youngstock are discussed in Chapter 10. Still, lactating cattle continue to grow during the first and second lactation, therefore, Chapter 6 includes an equation to estimate the NP used for frame growth. Eq 6-12, p. 87 \\[\\text{NP frame gain (g/d)} = \\text{Frame weight gain (g/d)} * 0.11 *0.86\\] This is because frame growth is assumed to include 11% CP on an as-is basis, with 86% TP. According to NASEM (2021), 0.19 and 0.15 kg/d of frame growth rates are reasonable targets for frame growth in first and second lactation Holsteins. After the second lactation, frame growth is typically assumed to be zero. Frame growth is assumed to represent 85% of live weight growth. Figure 13.4: Frame growth targets in NASEM (2021) for first, second, and third or greater lactations Body reserve gain The equation for body reserve gain is similar, except that body reserves are assumed to contain 8% CP. Target body reserve gain is specified by the user based on the animal's current and target body reserve status. Eq 6-12, p. 87 \\[\\text{NP reserve gain (g/d)} = \\text{Body reserve gain (g/d)} * 0.08 * 0.86\\] 13.7 Total NP use The total NP use is estimated by summing the predicted use of NP for each body function: \\[\\text{Total NP use, g/d} = \\text{NPScurf} + \\text{NPEndUrinary} + \\text{NPMFP} + \\text{NPMilk} + \\\\[16pt] \\text{NPGestation} + \\text{NPGrowth} \\] Endogenous urinary, metabolic fecal, and scurf proteins are sometimes referred to collectively as \"maintenance\" uses. This is because these requirements exist across animals to \"maintain\" body function. In contrast, pregnancy, lactation, and growth can be considered \"productive\" uses. 13.8 AA basis To convert each of these NP equations to an AA basis, multiply the NP use by the AA composition of the respective protein fraction. AA composition of CP and TP fractions is given in Table 6-2 in NASEM (2021; p. 79). The AA composition of body growth and the growth of the gravid uterus are assumed to equal the \"Whole Empty Body\" AA composition. Figure 13.5: AA composition of protein fractions as listed in NASEM (2021, p. 79) as a percentage of TP. Example Calculate the scurf net protein and amino acids recommended for a 550 kg Jersey cow. Scurf NP requirement. \\[\\text{NPScurf (g/d)} = 0.17*(550^{0.60})\\] \\[ = 7.5 \\text{ g/d}\\] Convert to AA basis. \\[ NetAA use = \\begin{bmatrix} \\text{Arg % of TP in export or body pool} \\\\ \\text{His % of TP in export or body pool} \\\\ \\text{Ile % of TP in export or body pool} \\\\ \\text{Leu % of TP in export or body pool} \\\\ \\text{Lys % of TP in export or body pool} \\\\ \\text{Met % of TP in export or body pool} \\\\ \\text{Phe % of TP in export or body pool} \\\\ \\text{Thr % of TP in export or body pool} \\\\ \\text{Trp % of TP in export or body pool} \\\\ \\text{Val % of TP in export or body pool} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} * (\\text{NP use for export or body pool}) \\] 13.9 Recommendations The NASEM (2021) adopted a factorial approach to calculate total NP use, which means that the daily NP use is determined as the sum of the protein use for each relevant body function (maintenance, tissue growth, lactation and reproduction). The last step in evaluating the adequacy of protein nutrition for a diet is determining if the circulating MP (or metabolizable AA) supplied by the diet is sufficient given the predicted total NP (or Net AA) use. MP to NP MP is used with less than perfect efficiency (&lt;1.0 ratio of NP to MP). When considering MP as a whole (not individual AA), the efficiencies of converting MP to NP depend on the body function. Scurf, metabolic fecal protein, milk, and growth share the same target efficiency of MP use (0.69; NASEM, 2021). The use of MP for gestation is much less efficient, so an efficiency of 0.33 is used. Finally, endogenous urinary N losses are endproducts of N metabolism, so they are assigned an efficiency of 1.0 (NASEM, 2021, p. 87). In summary, the total recommended MP supply (g/d) can be calculated using the predicted NP uses (g/d) for each body function: Eq. 6-14a, p. 89, NASEM (2021) \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Recommended MP supply} &amp;= \\frac{(NPScurf + NPMFP + NPMilk + NPGrowth)}{0.69} +\\\\[16pt] &amp;\\quad\\frac{NPGestation}{0.33} + \\frac{NPEndogenousUrinary}{1.0} \\end{aligned} \\] Metabolizable AA to Net AA For a given AA (\\(AA_i\\)), the equation is similar, except that a target efficiency specific to that AA can be used, rather than a target efficiency for the entire MP fraction. NASEM provides target efficiencies for each AA for export proteins (Table 6-4, p. 88, NASEM, 2021). However, the efficiencies for gestation and endogenous urinary MP to NP use are fixed to 0.33 and 1.0, respectively. This is because there was insufficient data to recommend efficiencies specific to each AA for these body functions. Eq. 6-14b, p. 89, NASEM (2021) \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Recommended metabolizable supply of }AA_i &amp;= \\frac{(NetAA_iScurf + NetAA_iMFP + NetAA_iMilk + NetAA_iGrowth)}{TargetEffAA_i} + \\\\[16pt] &amp;\\quad \\frac{NetAA_iGestation}{0.33} + \\frac{NetAA_iEndogenousUrinary}{1.0} \\end{aligned} \\] Table 9.1.

The committee acknowledged that a lot of data was available on milk protein production, and data on protein use for other body functions were very limited. However, they found it reasonable to assume that the animal would use protein for non-milk-production body functions (e.g., maintenance functions) before milk protein production was maximized. In general, nutrition studies have shown that milk protein production increases with greater MP supply, then reaches a maximum, and declines if MP supply is excessive, forming a curve shape. Therefore, they set out to find the efficiencies of MP to NP use at maximal milk protein production. The NASEM (2021) consensus report gives great detail about the process used by the committee to determine target MP and AA efficiencies. To envision the approach, we can construct a fictional example. Our example will describe a simplified way to determine MP to NP conversion efficiencies using an approach based on NASEM (2021). Develop a database with animal characteristics (e.g., body weight, milk protein production) and diet information. Use the database to generate predicted supplies of MP in each scenario, and predicted use of NP for each body function using the NASEM (2021) model. For each scenario, determine the MP available for milk protein production, after protein needs for other body functions have been met. Plot the MP available for milk protein production against the observed milk NP output. Fit a model to describe the observed data in an equation with linear and quadratic terms (Figure). Determine the derivative of the equation (Figure). Set the derivative equal to zero to determine the maximum of the curve, where the marginal return to additional MP is zero. The maximum will have an X value and Y value describing the available MP and NP output, respectively. Calculate the efficiency of NP to MP use for milk protein production at maximum NP output, by dividing the NP output (Y value) by the MP supply (X value on figure).

Abomasum The fourth digestive chamber of the digestive system of most ruminants. The abomasum is located after the forestomachs (rumen, reticulum and omasum) and before the first segment of the small intestine (i.e., the duodenum); It is sometimes referred to as the \"true\" stomach because of its acid-secreting ability, which is found in most other mammalian species. As-Is Basis A method of expressing the concentration of a nutrient in a feed. For example, a feed containing 12% crude protein on a dry matter basis contains 12 g of protein for each 100 g of feed \"as-is\" (or \"fresh\"). When feed ingredients are added to a mixer, they are weighted on an \"as-is\" of \"fresh\" basis. See also \"Dry Matter Basis. NA The fourth digestive chamber of the digestive system of most ruminants. The abomasum is located after the forestomachs (rumen, reticulum and omasum) and before the first segment of the small intestine (i.e., the duodenum); It is sometimes referred to as the \"true\" stomach because of its acid-secreting ability, which is found in most other mammalian species. Bezoar A small stony concretion that may form in the stomachs of certain animals, especially ruminants. Bezoars are caused by a buildup of material in the gastrointestinal tract that the stomach can't digest. Bloat A swelling of the left side of the cow caused by a frothy material which prevents gases of fermentation from being eructed from the rumen. Occurs primarily when cows are grazing certain species of legumes especially, alfalfa. If not treated immediately, bloat can cause death in a matter of hours. More... Buffer A chemical substances, such as sodium bicarbonate, that can maintain the pH of the rumen content around neutrality (pH = 6 to 7). The pH is maintained by neutralizing the volatile fatty acids and other organic acids produced by ruminal fermentation. Bull (Clean-Up) A bull used for natural mating after mutiple artificial insemination attempts have failed to establish pregnancy. Calorie A unit of heat that can be used to measure the amount of energy in a feed or a ration.

The cell wall is composed of digestible fibrous carbohydrates (cellulose; hemicellulose and pectin) and an indigestible phenolic compounds (e.g., lignin and tannin). Cellulose (C6h10o5)N: A polymer - long chain- of glucose units. Cellulose is the most abundant organic matter in the world. It is a major component of plant cell wall. Ruminant can use cellulose as an energy source because of fermentation by bacteria in the rumen. Cereal A plant in the grass family (gramineae), the seeds (i.e., grain) of which are used for human and animal food (e.g., maize, rice and wheat). Chaff Glumes, husk, or other seed coverings, together with the plant parts, separated from seeds in threshing or processing.

Colostrum The thick and yellowish secretion collected from the mammary gland at the first milking after calving. The colostrum is low in lactose but normally high in total solid (24%). It is rich in fat, proteins and antibodies that help the new born calf to fight infectious diseases. The secretion collected from the second to the eighth milking is referred to as \"transition milk\" because of it intermediate composition between colostrum and whole milk.

The word concentrate is also used to refer to the mixture of minerals and other supplements used to feed dairy cattle. Crown Base of the stem where roots arise Crude Protein A measure of the amount of protein in a feed determined as the amount of nitrogen multiplied by 6.25. The factor 6.25 is the average grams of protein that contains 1 gram of nitrogen. The word \"crude\" refers to the fact that not all nitrogen in most feed is exclusively in the form of protein. Because most feeds contain non-protein nitrogen (NPN), crude protein generally overestimates the actual protein content of a feed. Density A measure of the concentration of matter per unit of volume (e.g., g/l or kg/m3) Diarrhea Pathologically excessive evacuation of watery feces. Diarrhea may be due to an infectious agent (bacterial infection) or a dietary imbalance. Digesta The mixture of digestive secretion, bacterial population and feeds undergoing digestion in the gastro-intestinal tract (such as rumen content). Digestibility (Coefficient Of) A measure of the proportion of a feed that is digestible. The digestibility of a nutrient is often measured asthe difference between the amount of nutrient ingested minus the amount of nutrient excreted in the feces, expressed as a percentage of the nutrient ingested: 100 x (intake - excreted)/intake. If animals could completely metabolize (combust) the entire mass of feed they ate, there would be no need for excreting feces. Yet clearly, some fraction of the energy and nutrients in feed is not digested by the animal. In other words, some fraction of feed escapes being broken down into simpler molecules (digestion) and is instead excreted in feces. The apparent digestibility of a feed is defined as the amount that apparently disappeared between entering the animal's mouth (Intake) and exiting in feces (Excreted). Most commonly, we calculate digestibility for the total gastrointestinal tract (the total tract digestibility) although it is possible to calculate digestibility for segments of the digestive tract (e.g., ruminal digestibility). \\[ Apparent \\space Digestibility \\space (\\%) = \\frac{Intake \\space (g) - Excreted \\space (g)}{Intake \\space (g)} * 100 \\] We call this \"apparent\" digestibility because is clearly visible to us. However, for some nutrients apparent digestibility is problematic. It does not take into account that feces contains not only undigested feed nutrients, but also losses from endogenous sources. For example, the regular turnover of cells and production of mucus in the gastrointestinal tract results in endogenous losses of protein. \\[ True \\space Digestibility \\space (\\%) = \\frac{Intake \\space (g) - \\bigg( Excreted \\space (g) - Endogenous \\space (g) \\bigg)}{Intake \\space (g)} * 100 \\] True digestibility includes a correction for endogenous losses of the nutrient. Dry Cow A non-lactating cow. The dry period is the time between lactation, when the cow is not secreting milk. Dry Matter That part of the feed which is not water. It is usually determined by the residual weight of a sample placed for a period of time in a drying oven that removes the water from the sample. Usually, the dry matter content of a feed is expressed as a percentage. For example, an hay of 85% dry matter contains 85 g of dry matter for each 100 g of fresh feed. Dry Matter Basis A method of expressing the concentration of a nutrient in a feed. For example, a feed containing 12% crude protein on a dry matter basis contains 12 g of protein for each 100 g of feed dry matter Dry Matter Intake Quantity of dry matter ingested by a cow in a 24 h period. For example, a cow eating 18 kg of grass silage of 33% of dry matter ingest 18 x 0.33 = 6 kg of grass silage dry matter. Duodenum First part of the small intestine.

Fibrous Carbohydrate Hemicellulose and cellulose that can be quantify by the neutral detergent fiber procedure. Fodder Coarse feeds, such as straw, corn or sorghum stalks. Forage Feed that stimulate rumination due to their long particle size and their high content in fiber. Generally, forages are composed of the leaves and stems (stalk of plants. The bacterial population of the rumen allows the ruminant to digest forages. Forage To Concentrate Ratio Usually expressed as two percentages. The percentage of ration dry matter that is made up of forage and the percentage of ration dry matter that is composed of concentrates. The two total 100. For example a 50:50 forage to concentrate ratio means that a cow eating 20 kg of dry matter of that ration would eat 10 kg of concentrate dry matter and 10 kg of forage dry matter.
