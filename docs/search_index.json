Danes, Universidade Federal de Lavras 2023-03-14 Chapter 1 About this module Figure 1.1: Cover of ‘Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle, 8th edition’ 1.1 Purpose The NASEM (2021) “Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle” consensus report is a distillation of our collective knowledge about dairy cattle nutrition in the U.S. in the form of written text and mathematical equations. The most recent edition (8th), hereafter referred to as NASEM (2021), includes two parts. First, a 502 page consensus report book describes advancements in the dairy nutrition literature in recent decades in the form of narrative text and prediction equations. Second, a software for Windows enables users to evaluate diet adequacy for a given scenario based on the equations explained in the book. Our online module and its accompanying resources for teachers are intended to promote learning from the NASEM (2021) materials. Because the NASEM (2021) narrative and software were designed for advanced dairy nutrition practitioners, they may be difficult for less-experienced learners. Our module is designed to highlight core concepts that will assist learners in understanding the NASEM narrative and utilizing the mathematical model in practice. Learning Objectives of this Module Raise learners’ knowledge and confidence working with nutritional models, using the example of the NASEM (2021) “Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle” 1.2 Structure of the module and materials for teachers 1.3 Intended audience This module is for anyone interested in learning about nutritional science and nutritional modeling. Although is discusses a dairy cattle nutritional model, it is NOT designed solely for dairy-interested learners. As the “Requirements” chapter illustrates, there is substantial overlap in how scientists describe nutritional processes for humans and other animal species. Throughout the module, we emphasized critical thinking about nutritional science rather than memorization of any particular dairy cattle nutrition facts. Therefore, we hope this module will be interesting and relevant for learners regardless of their interest in dairy cattle. 1.4 Assumptions about prior knowledge This module can be used by anyone, but it has been designed with the assumption that learners have some prior knowledge. Before starting this module, we suggest that learners should have: Intermediate understanding of nutritional physiology of ruminants, e.g., have taken an animal nutrition course Intermediate knowledge of dairy production systems, e.g., through an introductory animal science or management-focused course, or through personal/career-related experiences Basic skills with statistics and math (mean, standard deviation, regression) 1.5 Technology requirements To read the narrative and complete activities, need a computer and stable internet connection To run NASEM-8 software, need Windows operating system 1.6 Accessing the NASEM (2021) book The NASEM (2021) book provides a narrative that summarizes recent scientific literature on dairy nutrition and justifies choices made while developing the mathematical model. The narrative is rich with information on nutritional physiology, dairy herd management, dairy nutrition experimentation, and the model development process. Due to its information density and use of technical language, it may be overwhelming to read for less-experienced practitioners. For this reason, learners may find it helpful to read the NASEM (2021) book in a class or small-group setting where it is possible to ask questions and verify their understanding. Instructors and learners can work together to determine which sections of the text are appropriate to the learners’ current comprehension level. For intermediate learners, it may be best to complete this module first before spending much time reading the NASEM (2021) narrative. Advanced learners may be able to read through the NASEM (2021) Consensus Report simultaneous to completing the activities in this module. In some cases, learners may benefit from approaching the narrative in an informal “Journal Club”-style setting (arranged either by teachers or students!). Accessing NASEM (2021) consensus report At the time of writing, a print version of the NASEM 8th edition book is available for purchase at the link below. Eventually this material will be available to read for free online. https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25806/nutrient-requirements-of-dairy-cattle-eighth-revised-edition Earlier editions, e.g., 7th, NRC (2001) Earlier editions of “Nutrient Requirements for Dairy Cattle” are available to read for free online, for example, the 7th edition (2001): https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/9825/nutrient-requirements-of-dairy-cattle-seventh-revised-edition-2001 1.7 The NASEM-dairy-8 software Most of this module can be completed without using the NASEM-dairy-8 software. However, learners are encouraged to download and experiment with the NASEM dairy-8 software on their own time. Download instructions are available on the NASEM website. The NASEM dairy-8 software runs only on Windows operating system. Learners who wish to run NASEM dairy-8 can install it on a personal computer or a campus library computer. Learners with non-Windows operating system may be able to download the NASEM dairy-8 using virtual machines through platforms such as Virtual Box (https://www.virtualbox.org). However, this requires substantial computer expertise and may be inconvenient for everyday use. Accessing NASEM-dairy-8 software The NASEM-dairy-8 software for Windows is available to download as shown here: https://nap.nationalacademies.org/resource/25806/Installation_Instructions_NASEM_Dairy8.pdf Earlier software, e.g., NASEM-dairy-7 It is also possible to download the Windows software for NRC (2001), although NASEM recommendeds against having both NRC 2001 and NASEM 2021 software installed on the same computer. https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/9825/nutrient-requirements-of-dairy-cattle-seventh-revised-edition-2001 1.8 Running a simulation The easiest way to get started running NASEM-8 is to Load a pre-defined simulation.The software comes with several pre-defined simulations for different classes of animals (e.g., “Example Lactating Cow 100 DIM”). Loading a pre-defined simulation pre-loads all of the inputs describing an example animal, management scenario, and diet. This can be helpful to avoid entering unrealistic inputs. To run NASEM-8, users proceed through four sections: Inputs. In the first panel, users must specify the Program Settings. Most commonly, the default settings (Metric, Dry Matter) can be retained. In the second panel of Inputs, “Animal Description/Management” users can provide detail about the animal (e.g., age, breed, days in milk) and the management scenario (e.g., grazing vs. no grazing). Finally, the “Production” panel allows users to specify the expected rates of growth, changes in body reserves, and milk and component production. Feeds. In this section, users can select the feedstuffs that will comprise the ration (“Add Feeds to Ration”). The software is pre-loaded with a default Feed Library, which contains composition information for over 300 feeds commonly used in dairy rations. Ingredients in the feed library can be modified to create custom feeds (“Edit feed components and nutrients”), which users can save to the feed library (Save Feed in Feed Library) for later use. This section defines which feeds are used in the ration, but not the inclusion rates. Ration. Feeds selected in the prior section will appear in the Ration List. To create a ration, users enter either the amount of dry matter (DM) consumed or the feed’s percent of total diet DM. The bottom of the screen allows users to specify DMI manually (“Total Intake”) or to select from two estimated intakes produced by the NASEM model using the animal characteristics (e.g., milk production, parity, body weight). Using the “Set to 100%” allows users to easily scale diet information to 100%. This can be helpful to correct rounding errors (e.g., to fix ingredient composition that sums to 100.01 or 99.99% of DM). A sidebar shows quick estimates of the diet nutritional value, which makes it easier to tweak the ingredient composition to meet goals. Reports. Finally, users can generate reports detailing the predictions from the NASEM (2021) model. Nine types of reports are available. By selecting “10. All” and “Generate Selected Reports,” a Word document is created and opened. Users can look through the Word document to see predicted nutrient supplies and requirements associated with their inputs. It is also possible to generate an excel spreadsheet with the nutrient composition of ingredients. This may be helpful for users who wish to do their own manual calculations. Some of the most common mistakes when using NASEM dairy-8 relate to improper inputs. For example, a user could enter a body weight of 7,000 instead of 700 kg in the Animal Description; or create a custom feed with unrealistic nutrient composition. For this reason, it is easiest to use pre-loaded simulations and default Feed Library ingredients in classroom settings. This will prevent many hours of troubleshooting related to improper inputs. NOTE: Even with perfectly-matched inputs, the NASEM software is more up-to-date than the consensus report. For this reason, the outputs may differ slightly when using equations in the book versus the reports generated in the software. More details are given in the next section. 1.9 Known discrepancies The software is under continual improvement, whereas the book is static. According to the NASEM-8 software “help” documentation, the latest software and R code contains the most correct and up-to-date version of the NASEM model. To avoid confusion, our module will use the NASEM model equations given in the software. 1.9.1 Software updates and bugs Since the software was released, several updates have been made. Users should ensure they have the latest version of NASEM-8 downloaded to avoid any errors. The errors below may be encountered with older versions: With versions of NASEM-8 software downloaded prior to 2023.03.11, user-entered target milk production, milk protein production, and milk fat were silently overridden with predicted values. This resulted in NEL, urine energy, and other values reported incorrectly. This bug has been fixed by the developer in subsequent releases. In certain cases, the NEL balance in the sidebar does not match the Word document output. In certain versions of the NASEM-8 software, manure volatile solids was overwritten by manure water in tabular output in Word. 1.9.2 Inconsistencies between the book and software The most recent software is more up-to-date than the equations in the Consensus Report book. Most discrepancies result in relatively small differences in predictions as a result of fine-tuning parameters. Known discrepancies between the book and software include: The kg of CP in gravid uterus per kg of calf birth weight (CP_GrUtWt) differs from book p. 87. The kg gravid uterus weight per fetal birthweight (GrUterWt_FetBWbrth) differs from book p. 31. The energy (Mcal/kg) fresh gravid uterus weight (NE_GrUtWt) at birth differs from book p. 31. The amount of CP (kg/kg) in fresh gravid uterus weight (CP_GrUtWt) differs from book p. 87. The coefficient for digestible energy in urinary nitrogen differs from the book (p. 32?). Estimated manure output (Man_out) uses a different equation than those listed in the Environment chapter. The coefficient for NDF in the methane emission equation for heifers is positive in the book (p. 302), and negative in the software. The intercept for the methane production of non-lactating dairy cows is positive in the book (p. 302; 14-1c) and negative in the software. Additionally, note that CF is crude fat, not crude fiber! In the book (eq. 13-4, p. 304) the CP:N factor is listed as 0.638. It is 0.634 (6.34) in the software. The 6.34 factor is consistent with the Protein chapter. 1.10 Suggested citations If you use this module, please give credit by citing our work and the NASEM report.

List and differentiate common dairy nutritional models. Describe how nutritional models are developed, step-by-step. 2.1 A brief history Figure 2.1: Cattle painted circa 7000 years ago in the Libyan Sahara (Sapienza University of Rome) Deliberate animal feeding began before recorded history with the advent of agriculture in Asia and Africa 12,000 years ago (Coffey et al. 2016). Since this time, humans have carefully considered how to manage forages, grains, minerals, and other natural resources to provide nourishment for domesticated animals. In regions throughout the world, traditional and indigenous knowledge systems contain a wealth of information on animal nutritional management, yet very little of it is recorded in publications and books. Primarily in the last 200 years, animal nutrition developed as a scientific discipline. The use of scientific methods enabled researchers to isolate the chemical components of feeds and to quantitatively relate dietary intakes to physiological effects. As nutrition science progressed, nutritional diseases that had once harmed or killed thousands of animals (and people) began to be curable. The productivity of agricultural animals began to increase. As per the scientific method, advances were recorded with detailed publications in the scientific literature to enable cumulative progress. In the United States, nutrition science was spurred by government efforts to reconstruct and reduce poverty after wars. In the aftermath of the Civil War and World Wars, the U.S. government chartered the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and its subsidiary organization the National Research Council (NRC, Ullrey 2001). NASEM is a non-governmental, non-profit organization of academics whose mission is to translate scientific information into domestic policy and practice. In animal nutrition, NASEM is famous for organizing efforts to consolidate nutritional science knowledge into animal feeding recommendations by publishing consensus reports. The first edition of “Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle” was published by the NRC (NASEM’s subsidiary) in 1945. In the eight decades following, researchers created seven more editions of this consensus report. Each edition uses the most up-to-date research on dairy cattle nutrition generated by researchers at universities and government institutions. 2.2 NASEM (2021) and other dairy nutrition models NASEM (2021) is one of several dairy cattle nutrition models. In most cases, models are intended to serve as decision support tools. In other words, the model estimates are intended to help dairy stakeholders, especially dairy farm managers, make more-informed decisions. The Cornell Net Protein and Carbohydrate System (CNCPS) is an alternative model upon which commercial ration formulation programs such as AMTS have been built. CNCPS also influence the development of The Large Ruminant Nutrition System (LRNS) by Texas A&amp;M researchers. In recent years, the importance of evaluating the environmental and economic impacts of dairy production have led to the development of models not just focused on the animal-level variables (as with NASEM), but instead integrating information about the entire farm system. These models, for example, the Ruminant Farm Systems (RuFaS) model, incorporate detailed information about local weather, soil characteristics, crop growth and storage, and prices of feedstuffs. Some programs allow users to optimize the inclusion rate of selected diet ingredients (e.g., least cost ration formulation; AMTS program). In contrast, NASEM (2021) is designed to evaluate existing diets rather than formulate new diets that optimize user-defined parameters or meet user-defined constraints. Additionally, NASEM (2021) predicts selected environmental impacts at the individual animal, predominantly based on dietary factors. Thus, NASEM (2021) predictions of environmental impacts do not integrate farm system information to the same extent as other models, e.g., RuFaS.

The cave painting of cattle is a two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional animals. It conveys some information about cattle and how they are shaped. Although we cannot know the intention of its artist(s), perhaps they meant to use the cave painting to communicate some information about cattle they had observed. The painting is a “snapshot” in time that summarizes and communicates about cattle. A nutritional model (for example, the NASEM dairy model) is also a representation of cattle. Instead of a two-dimensional artwork, nutritional models are generally represented mathematically. The tens or hundreds of mathematical expressions that comprise a nutritional model are intended to summarize and communicate what we know about cattle nutrition. Similar to the painting, a model is a representation of reality. 2.4 Usefulness Models are mathematical and/or statistical descriptions of inputs, processes, and outputs. Nutritional models function as decision-support tools that can use known information (e.g., feed composition, animal characteristics) to predict how nutritional processes will unfold and what outcomes will result. They can be used to answer various types of questions. Scenario 1 A dairy nutritionist has access to many different feedstuffs with known chemical composition. They have several different pens of animals to feed (e.g., calves, dry cows, lactating cows, high-producing lactating cows). How do they create diets for each pen of animals? A nutritional model can help determine the requirements for each pen of animals. Additionally, the nutritional model can determine which feeds can be combined to create diets that meet the requirements. Scenario 2 A group of dairy producers aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their farm so they can reach carbon-neutral production goals. How can they select diets that contribute to their environmental goals? A nutritional model could help these producers predict the environmental impact of their current production practices, or explore hypothetical alternative diets and scenarios. Scenario 3 A dairy nutritionist has a suspicion that a group of cows is not producing as much milk fat as they could be, given the diet and animal characteristics. How does the nutritionist test their hypothesis? A nutritional model can be used to benchmark production. Benchmarking means comparing the observed value against a reference value to evaluate its adequacy. In this case, the nutritionist could enter the diet and cow information to predict the expected milk fat production under these conditions. Then, they could compare this reference (expected) value to their observed value to benchmark. Scenario 4 Feed costs for certain ingredients have changed, and a nutritionist wants to ensure they can meet animal needs and maintain performance at the least possible cost. How can they create a diet that minimizes feed costs? A nutritional model can be used to optimize diets based on certain constraints. For example, least cost formulation is a common approach. It involves finding the combination of ingredients that will create a diet that meets animal requirements and costs the least amount. 2.5 Let’s develop a simple nutritional model Nutritional models are developed through scientific processes. To get a sense of how nutritional models work, let’s go through a fictional example and develop our own (very simple!) nutritional model. We need to follow the following steps: Hypothesis generation Data collection (through observation and experimentation) Model development Model verification and generation of new hypotheses …repeat the process ad infinitum 2.5.1 Hypothesis generation Imagine that a researcher has some cattle in individual stalls. They ensure each cow has as much feed as she wants to consume (ad libitum feeding). Over time, the researcher starts to notice that the larger cattle seem to eat more. They write this observation into their notebook. What the researcher has just done is the rough beginning of generating a hypothesis: Larger cows seem to consume more feed than smaller cows. After thinking about it some more, they can refine their hypothesis to make it more testable. For example, rather than “larger cows”, which is somewhat vague, they can be more specific and say “greater bodyweight.” Rather than saying “eat more,” they can say “consume more dry matter on a daily basis.” Now, we have a testable hypothesis: In lactating cows, greater bodyweight is associated with greater dry matter intake on a daily basis. By gathering empirical data, we can test this hypothesis. If we find evidence that this relationship is true, we can use it to build a nutritional model. 2.5.2 Data collection through observation (or experimentation) To learn more about the hypothesized relationship between body size and feed intake, the researcher decides to find a larger group of cattle to collect observational data. They collect two pieces of information in each observation: 1) the animal’s body weight (BW), and 2) the animal’s dry matter intake (DMI). They use the data to create a plot: Figure 2.2: DMI vs BW for 300 observations from lactating cows Test Yourself: What would you conclude from the plot? After looking at the plot, the researcher believes that it supports their hypothesis: DMI and BW are positively related. In other words, if an animal’s BW is known, its DMI can be guessed with some accuracy. The researcher decides to convert this observed relationship to a mathematical model. Because the relationship seems to follow a line, they fit a regression with the linear form \\(y = mx + b\\). Figure 2.3: Fitted regression model predicting DMI from BW for lactating cows 2.5.3 Model development By fitting a regression model to the observed points, they get an estimate of the slope (0.03) that relates BW and DMI. In other words, the average DMI observed was 3% of the animal BW. This single mathematical expression is a very simple nutritional model: \\(DMI = 0.03 * BW\\) The researcher thinks the model will be useful for prediction. They decide to test the predictive performance of the model by buying a new lactating cow. They record the cow’s BW as 625 kg. Figure 2.4: Fitted regression model predicting DMI from BW for lactating cows Test Yourself: Using our simple nutritional model, what is this cow’s predicted DMI? 2.5.4 Model verification To predict the DMI of the new cow, the researcher enters the known information (cow’s BW) into the nutritional model: \\(DMI = 0.03 * 625\\). The model predicts the cow’s DMI will be 18.75 kg. Tracing up from the x-axis, the intersection of the red dashed line with the blue line shows the predicted DMI for an animal with BW = 625. Next, the researcher decides to verify their model by measuring the animal’s actual DMI. Figure 2.5: Actual DMI for a new observation (red point) of a cow with BW = 625 kg Uh oh…. the actual DMI observed is shown with the large red point. It is greater than the prediction. This means that the model under-predicted the actual DMI for this cow based on her BW. This causes the researcher to go back to their original model, \\(DMI = 0.03 * BW\\). The variable BW seems to explain some, but not all of the variation in DMI. Test Yourself: What should the researcher do next? There are several courses of action to be considered. First, the researcher could leave the model as-is, and attribute the error in prediction to un-explainable variation. Un-explainable variation comes from unknown and un-measurable sources, including the intrinsic randomness of the universe. Second, the researcher could try to gather more information to find other measurable predictors of DMI besides BW. Then, they could revise the nutritional model to include other variables that determine the DMI. 2.5.5 Model refinement (re-starting the process) Generally, scientists take the second option. In our example, the researcher might go back to their notebook and consider… what other factors could be affecting DMI aside from BW? Eventually, they would develop a new hypothesis, for example: younger, first-lactation animals will consume less than more mature animals with two or more lactations. They plot the data again, including information about the animals’ parity: Figure 2.6: DMI vs BW for 300 observations from lactating cows, by parity It appears there is some variation explained by parity. In this way, the researcher can update the model to include other variables, e.g., \\(DMI = 0.03 * BW + ParityEffect\\). Nutritional models with multiple variables are difficult to visualize, but they are conceptually similar to the simpler model in our example. 2.6 Conclusions and additional complexity Congratulations - you created and used your first nutritional model! Our model involved the relationships between three variables, DMI, BW, and parity, making it relatively simple. In the subsequent chapters, we will discuss models that contain hundreds of variables, related by many types of mathematical expressions. Our simple example used a linear relationship, but nutritional models can also contain non-linear relationships. In our example, the effects of BW and Parity were independent and additive. Most nutritional models also include mathematical terms that describe interactions between variables. If this sounds complex, it’s because it is complex! People have devoted entire careers to refining small subcomponents of the nutritional models we use. It’s important to remember that our goal in this module is to gain a general understanding of nutritional models. If you are interested to learn all the details…maybe graduate school is a good fit for you.
